Abbot
My vow of poverty has made me rich, my vow of obedience has made me a lord. My vow of chastity? Ah...
(ToS) The eldest and wisest of monks eventually rise to become the leaders of their monasteries. Worshippers sometimes
seek these abbots out to gain their advice on matters of faith or to gain greater understanding about the religious
world, while priests and initiates answer to them in all things. Most abbots choose to remain secluded in their
monasteries until death takes them, but some venture out into the wider world once again. Few abbots deign
to get involved in temple politics, preferring the solitude of their own world or their journeys to the
machinations of their cult. For this reason an abbot is rarely the head of a mendicant order, leaving the
organisation and politicking to a high priest.

Little Known Facts
Technically, abbots are legally answerable only to the head of their order,
the head of their cult, and the Emperor himself. This legal privilege
dates back centuries, and although most abbots know about it, very few
take advantage of it on a day-to-day basis. Still, an abbot can legally
tell an Elector Count to mind his own business, and one with the full
backing of his cult might even get away with it.
 There are two kinds of abbots: those promoted from within the abbey
through a closely guarded internal process, and those appointed by high
priests or prelates from the outside. Insiders are often more popular with
the monks, but outsiders are normally more enthusiastic about reforms.
Sometimes the monks are so split that an outsider is the only way to
avoid the fragmentation of the abbey, and sometimes the abbey is so
remote that only an insider would take the post.
A handful of remote fortresses in the Empire are garrisoned by orders
of warrior priests or monks, most often Sigmarites. These fortresses
come under frequent attack, and the abbots are often men with military
experience. Since religious experience is also necessary, most of them are
promoted internally. In recognition of their dual role, they are known
formally as castellans.
Revered Father Steffron Kurdtz
Steffron Kurdtz is the abbot of a Sigmarite monastery in the Imperial
heartlands. He is respected and loved by the monks, and his reputation
for wisdom has spread as far as Altdorf and Middenheim. He has been
abbot for many years, but is still vigorous despite his age. He talks of
retiring, but none of the monks will hear of it.
Steffron took a circuitous route to his current station of abbot. In fact, a
life of faith and service was the furthest thing from his mind as a youth
ranging through the forests of Talabecland. Steffron earned his living as a
hunter and guide, and paid more heed to Taal and Rhya than the patron
god of the Empire. One day, he guided a pilgrimage of Sigmarites to a
holy site deep within the forests. They were attacked by beastmen, and
Steffron was inspired by the Sigmarite’s unflappable faith and resolve in
the face of danger.
After fending off the beastmen, Steffron joined the pilgrimage, learning
about the faith from those whom he had fought with side-by-side. After
completing the journey, Steffron officially joined the Cult of Sigmar as an
initiate and worked tirelessly to test his faith, uncover truths and challenge
unbelievers. Over the decades, he has shared his personal story of struggle
and deliverance countless times, converting many people to the faith.
Adventure Seeds
Troubling News: A new monk joins the monastery, and he is clearly
deeply troubled by something. At length he tells the story to the abbot,
who is shocked. The terrible experience is connected to an abandoned
shrine the abbot had visited before he entered the monastery, a shrine
corrupted by Nurgle cultists. The monk asserts the shrine has reverted
to its corrupt status, and needs to be cleansed.
A Golden Secret: The ancient abbey was very wealthy in the past.
Recently it has fallen on harder times, and many buildings are scarcely
used. The new abbot is more energetic than his predecessors, and
sends the monks to repair and clean the old buildings. One comes to
him secretly, showing him a symbol of Chaos he found in one of the
buildings. It is made of gold, and they cannot detrmine how long it has
been there. The abbot must avoid scandal, while making sure that the
Dark Gods do not have a foothold in his abbey.

Admiral
I don’t care about the shoals. If Bruckmeier and Lowenstein haven’t tacked two leagues east-southeast
of their position by fourteen-hundred hours, we’ll be eating catapult shot for dinner. And then those
Orc pirates will be eating us.
(SoE) Commanding a fleet of ships, Admirals are the true lords of the sea. While most are
employed by one of the navies of the Old World, some Admirals are pirates commanding
a flotilla of bloodthirsty marauders. Many Sea Captains envy their position, so Admirals
must be quick-witted and charismatic to see off attacks; after all, once at sea, almost
anything can happen, and only the survivors can tell the tale. Because of this, many Admirals
are paranoid individuals who are jealous of their power, and most are quick to end any
imagined mutiny with their loyal Marines or Pirates.

Baarten’s Privateers
Admiral Baarten was the captain of a Marienburg merchant fleet that
traded with the Border Princes, until one fateful day when it ran afoul
of Sartosan pirates. Three trading cogs carrying ivory and Cathayan silk
were captured by the pirates, and two were sunk. Baarten’s damaged
command frigate fled into a coral reef. The captain barely escaped with
his life. Returning to Marienburg responsible for a two million Guilder
loss, Baarten drank away the next four years on the Suiddock pier.
Marienburg’s press gangs recruited Admiral Baarten into service on
three occasions. Granted, Baarten had been an able seaman before
gaining captaincy so he knew how to tie a knot, but the wages were
terrible and his fellow sailors treated him with disrespect now that he
was their equal.
Baarten’s fortunes turned when a wealthy benefactor bought the ships
of a bankrupt merchant and offered Baarten a job as admiral of a small
privateer fleet. Baarten has achieved resounding success hunting pirates
with a 54-gun war galley and two old trading carracks refitted to carry
18 guns apiece. His marine force now exceeds 200 men.
Flagships
The admiral’s flagship is the largest in the fleet. In battle, the admiral
supervises operations from the elevated fore or aft deck of his flagship.
Orders are conveyed to the captains of other ships by a signalman, using
patterned flags. Signal flags are hoisted up the flagship’s mast when the
fleet is operating in loose formation, such as during a naval blockade,
or when communicating with approaching fleets. In conditions of poor
visibility, the signalman uses a hooded lantern or carrier pigeons.
Enemy flagships are often targeted in battle with the purpose of
disrupting fleet command. For this reason, the flagship usually sails at
the center of the formation. The admiral of a sunken flagship, if not
rescued quickly by another ship in his fleet, might be captured by the
enemy and held for ransom – or worse.
Flagships belong to the mighty Man O’ War class. The Empire
Greatship is perhaps the most famous Man O’ War, with bow and stern
gun decks supplementing its broadside array. The Bretonnian Galleon
is faster than the Greatship and carries a more powerful broadside, but
lacks fore and aft guns. Dwarven Men O’ War are called Ironclads;
steam-powered paddle ships covered in metal plates and armed
with turret-mounted cannons. Elven flagships are catamarans called
Dragonships that have fearsome Dragonblade rams attached to each of
their twin prows and bolt throwers for ranged engagement.
Many fleets employ a powerful battle wizard aboard the admiral’s
flagship to provide magical support.
Adventure Seeds
Insubordination: One of the captains of an Imperial fleet frequently
challenges the admiral’s orders, and this is beginning to have an impact
on the fleet’s morale and performance. The insubordinate captain also
happens to be the ambitious son of a powerful duke, and things must be
handled delicately – so the admiral has asked others to intervene on his
behalf for the sake of the fleet..
The Stormy Sea: While an Imperial fleet is patrolling the Sea of Claws,
its admiral spots an unnatural-looking cyclone through his telescope.
Daemons swirl within the funnel, which veers towards the ship. If the
cyclone overtakes the admiral’s fleet, it will transport the ships to a
strange sea in the Realms of Chaos.

Agent of the Shroud
Dead? Yes. For now. But notice the bite marks. Can there be any doubt? I know he was your brother, but
now he needs you one last time… He needs you to bring him eternal peace.
(NDM) The splinter order of Morrites, known as the Fellowship of the Shroud, takes a much
more active view of their duties to Morr than the mainstream cult. Its members include warriors,
priests, and Vampire hunters, but in many situations, a far subtler hand is needed, and such
are the abilities of the Agents of the Shroud. These scholarly types are trained in careful
observation, medical examination, and logical deduction, so they may identify Vampire or
Undead activity without being detected. Some of them turn their results over to more martially
skilled members of their cult, but they are quite capable of enacting their own justice and
putting an end to those the Fellowship call “the Enemies of Life.”
The Agents of the Shroud investigate any suspicious death for signs of necromancy or dark magic,
so they are often involved in murder mysteries that turn out to contain no mystical elements. Their
services are appreciated by the victim’s family regardless, and the Agents are happy to help any
departed spirits rest.

Doctor Hertwig Teichmann
A medical scholar and physician who has turned his expertise to the
detection of the vampire, Doctor Teichmann’s reasons for combating the
undead are quite personal. During his younger days, he was a respected
doctor who practiced his beneficent arts in Nuln. he saved countless
lives, and his reputation grew daily. He was destined, it seemed, to live a
peaceful and prosperous life aiding his fellow man. This was not to be.
A corpse was found in an alleyway behind a seedy bar and through
its heart was a stake. The watch brought the corpse to Teichmann,
wondering if he could shed any light on this bizarre murder. Doctor
Teichmann unwisely removed the stake to examine it for evidence.
That night the vampire returned to life. Doctor Teichmann found the
creature with its fangs in the neck of his beloved fiancée, Katharina. In
a rage, the doctor seized the stake and plunged it back into the breast of
the vile monster, but for Katharina is was too late.
She died, and to prevent her from rising from the dead, Doctor
Teichmann himself drove hawthorn through her heart and removed her
head. That night, the doctor sought out the Fellowship, and since then
has dedicated himself to seeing that his own tragedy is never repeated.
A Day in the Life
The Agents of the Shroud are first and foremost investigators. They
visit morgues frequently looking for evidence of their prey, and make
contacts among the local watch, hoping for a tip about anything
unusual. They are as likely to scan the news-sheets as they are to peruse
musty tomes of forbidden lore. An effective Agent is one who is well
connected and able to sift out facts from folklore and fantasy.
As a matter of survival, agents usually have another profession. Few
cities have such a large population of vampires that professional vampire
hunters and their assistants are always kept busy. Instead, an Agent
of the Shroud is likely to be a professional in another career, who has
joined the Fellowship and aids them whenever trouble presents itself.
A small handful of Agents travel from city to city, always looking for the
next nest of vampires, making this career their full time obsession. Only
the bravest of these dare patrol graveyards and dark alleyways, hoping to
stop an attack as it happens.
Adventure Seeds
Undeath Becomes Thee: Doctor Teichmann has reason to believe that
one of the most influential local noble houses is hiding a terrible secret
– a vampire amongst their kin. He dares not take action himself, but
needs aid from adventurers bold enough to raid the family mausoleum
and destroy the creature that hides therein.
Deadly Seduction: An Agent of the Shroud has betrayed the
Fellowship. Enthralled by a Lahmian vampiress of great beauty, he
is passing secrets to her. Most of the local Fellowship brethren have
already been slain and the rest have fled or are in hiding. If this
infestation and betrayal is to be answered, the Fellowship must turn to
outsiders for help.
Initiation Rights: A splinter sect of Morrites seeks to start their own
cabal of investigators mirrored after the Agents of the Shroud, but
focused more closely on uncovering and thwarting practitioners of
Necromancy. During one of their first missions, one of the new agents
is captured by the person they were sent to investigate. Can his fellow
investigators rescue him before he becomes the Necromancer’s next
unwilling subject?

Agitator
Friend –step closer! I would like to make you aware of a dire situation... an atrocity you may not be aware of. There’s
trouble my friend, trouble right here Altdorf.
(Core) For the most part, the people of the Empire have little say in politics. The Emperor and the Elector Counts make
and enforce the laws, with the support of the various churches (Sigmar and Ulric most conspicuously). Nonetheless,
ardent political activists are a common sight in the cities of the Empire. These Agitators organize on behalf of various
causes, handing out leaflets, giving rousing speeches, and stirring up the populace. The lunatic fringe is simply
ignored, but successful Agitators – those who can tap into the wellspring of Peasant and Burgher resentment –
are usually viewed as a threat to the state. They are hounded by local watchman, accused of heresy by church
officials, or forced to submit to the tender mercies of the Witch Hunters. Agitators continue on despite the
risks. Some truly believe in their cause, but others are cynical power seekers as corrupt as those they rail against.

No Rest for the Rhetorician
The agitator stands on a crowded street corner or market square, calling
out controversial slogans in the hopes of generating interest amongst the
bystanders. The agitator always keeps an eye out for the authorities –
who will likely take a dim view of his activities. If watchmen appear he
runs , unless he feels he has crowd on his side.
Once he gathers a crowd, the agitator launches into a more detailed
critique of society, and outlines his vision for the future. He pushes
his pamphlets on his audience, promising that they contain further
information and points out that they are as cheap as he can possibly
make them, that he is just hoping to cover his costs.
In the evening the agitator heads to a local tavern. His bar-stool
philosophical discussions make him popular with those he drinks with.
The agitator has a professional incentive for being there, however, and
has an ear out for any embittered anecdotes or conspiracy theories he
could use to reinforce his political agenda.
Late at night, the agitator pays a visit to a local printer’s workshop.
Most printers are too wary of the law to openly help such a notorious
individual, but they may have rebellious young apprentices or run an
illicit business at night. An agitator has to be careful in finding a willing
producer of seditious pamphlets, and works hard to establish and
maintain the necessary degree of trust.
Affiliations
An agitator is best advised to get to know the local watchmen and to
make contacts in the underworld. In the case of the watch it is simply
a case of knowing who to bribe or flee from. An agitator has a more
complex relationship with organised crime. On one hand underworld
contacts can offer the agitator just the sort of information he needs to
better attack his targets, and a place to hide if things get hot. On the
other hand, they have a nasty habit of calling in favours. Many agitators
wish to be perceived as idealistic and anti-materialistic, and do not like
to be seen associating with criminals.
In the Land of Illiteracy, the Spoken Word is King
Many question how agitators can gain such large followings, or have
such a strong influence over local politics and affairs. The role of the
spoken word cannot be underestimated in a land where far more people
are illiterate than literate. The illiterate are forced to rely on others for
news and information, since they cannot read the newssheets themselves
– an opportunity the savvy agitator is more than happy to seize.
Adventure Seeds
Are You Safe From the Ratmen? Sections of society seem reluctant
to admit the danger posed by skaven, going so far as to deny their
existence. An agitator makes it his mission to inform the masses of
the reality of the situation and wants to interview people who have
encountered skaven – such as parties of adventurers. However there are
those who would like to silence the agitator and any allies he makes.
Certain Imperial authorities are desperate not to see widespread panic
resulting from ‘irresponsible rumours.’
The Real Truth: Many agitators flocked to Wurtbad to support a
charismatic demagogue there, but they found themselves leaderless
when he died during a tavern brawl. Without a leader, the agitators
formed various factions, each interpreting his vision for society in a
different manner. An ideological turf war threatens to erupt unless the
situation settles down. PCs may become embroiled if they sympathise
with one of the agitator groups, or the authorities might approach them
to help police the increasing violence.

Ambassador
A Defensible Home Away
Any ambassador will say, in their own native tongues, “Putting your life
in the hands of foreigners with whom you deal puts your head in the
axe-man’s basket.” Thus, any building designated as an embassy must be
entirely secure for those dignitaries living in it. No matter where in the
Old World it lies, there are a number of factors that go into designating
a building an “embassy:”
•	 It is one of the highest-quality buildings in its settlement.
•	 It is secure, with guards at every visible egress and an external
defence (such as a curtain wall or portcullis).
•	 There is more than one entry/exit, though only the primary needs
to be undisguised.
•	 There are at least eight embassy guards for each ambassador,
beyond his personal guards.
•	 It is large enough to comfortably accomodate several ambassadors
and their retinues without needing to overcrowd them.
•	 The kitchens and servants quarters are routinely examined, and
cooking is done under the watchful eye of guards, to discourage
any attempts at poisoning.
Hedeon Dyakanov
Born during the great blizzards of 2468 at the Dyakanov estate on the
River Urskoy, Hedeon’s ice-silver eyes deemed him “Ulric-marked” from
birth. In time, his tongue proved equally silver as he charmed many far
beyond the means of his nigh-insolvent noble house. Brought to the
Kislevite court at a young age, Hedeon fled after incurring the vengeful
jealousy of certain noble courtiers. His time in exile in the Bretonnian
courts and the southern Empire taught him a greater command of
politics, both provincial and personal. It also helped him build an
unmatched personal network of contacts and allies among many
countries.
Since the Ice Queen’s rise, Lord Dyakanov has served the Tzarina
faithfully and earned his ambassadorial title. He has spoken her will
among the courts of Bretonnia, Estalia, and the Empire and she has
rewarded his family with riches for his service. As one of her covert
foreign spymasters, he receives intelligence from many sources within
Reikland and Wissenland. Hedeon has also used his position to
wreak secret vengeance upon the families who forced his exile decades
ago. Now, if any dare speak against him, they do so quietly, for his
retribution has a leagues-long reach.

The Delicate Art of Diplomacy: The party serves an ambassador
of a foreign country, and they may act as personal guards (or thugs),
investigators (or spies), and scouts (or explorers and mappers) at various
times. The ambassador’s title and position protects them from all but
the most egregious abuses of power in the execution of the ambassador’s
orders. Their first task is to escort the ambassador’s daughter safely from
Nuln to Marienburg.
Treating with Tilea: As a newly-titled ambassador (or a group of
ambassadors), the party is charged with negotiating and establishing
trade consortia between their country’s lands and as many of the Tilean
city-states as they can. The party must also make steps to guarantee the
safety of goods and peoples from their lands to Tilea and back.
Ambassador
To fight for one’s lands is a privilege. To speak for one’s lands is an honor.
(RotIQ) Granted the right to speak on behalf of their sovereign, ambassadors can wield much power
in the various national and provincial capitals of the Old World. In Kislev, ambassadors work tirelessly
from their well-guarded embassies, keen to do whatever is necessary to catch the Ice Queen’s eye. While
some ambassadors are chosen for their exquisite tastes and ability to spoil rivals and allies alike with carefully
chosen words and gifts, others may be selected for their sharp minds, understanding of intelligence networks,
or undeniable charisma. Whatever their individual strengths, all ambassadors are of noble birth, for the
Tzarina would never deign to meet a foreign peasant.
Special Requirements: You must be of noble birth (i.e. complete the Noble Career) and be
appointed by a government.

Anchorite
Pain? What pain? There is no pain. Only penance.
(RC) Some people feel that they can only follow their own mystical leanings alone, away from the distractions
of civilisation, conversation, and soap. These individuals become Anchorites, staking claim to a cave, or the top of
a pillar of rock, somewhere in the Borderlands. They have few or no possessions, so bandits
rarely bother them. Greenskins and other monsters are still likely to kill them if they can
catch them, so Anchorites learn how to hide and run away.

A Day in the Life
An anchorite’s life is one of contemplation and meditation brought
into focus by solitude and self-deprivation. Typically he finds a cave,
hole, or boulder to shelter under, things the badlands of the Border
Princes have in abundance. From this modest dwelling, he then begins
his journey into enlightenment. He spends days, weeks and months in
filth and hunger watching the movement of the sun, stars and moons
while contemplating his insignificance. Occasionally, when hunger
or thirst gets the better of him, he ventures out into the wastes to
dig insects from the ground and lick the dew from rocks. Even when
foraging, the anchorite is careful not to spend too long sating his feeble
bodily needs, lest he waste precious moments of contemplation and
endanger his chance at true awakening. The only other things that
might disturb this cycle of meagre subsistence and endless meditation
are the other inhabitants of the wastes, be they predatory wolves or
big cats, or bloodthirsty orcs. When such an encounter occurs, the
anchorite attempts to hide, or if this is impossible, flee, though the
more devout (or crazed) remain within their retreat, convinced that
their unwelcome visitor is sent to test their faith. Fortunately for most
anchorites however, the stink and scrawniness of their bodies make
them an unappetising meal, and all but the most desperate predators
leave them alone.
The Path to Enlightenment
An anchorite’s path to enlightenment is not an easy one. They must
be willing to sacrifice all that they are to become more than they were.
While each anchorite’s journey is different, those that would tread this
path must follow three simple rules.
Look within and ignore without – Meditation and contemplation
become an anchorite’s only priority, as he believes it is only through a
lifetime of introspection that he can achieve enlightenment. To this end,
an anchorite pays no heed to the feeble shadows of the world, ignoring
what he considers the illusion of matter to better focus on the workings
of the mind.
Break the shackles of the flesh – because an anchorite sees his body as a
weak fleshy anchor pinning him to this plane of existence, he considers
its needs and ills as insignificant. Hunger, disease and injury are all
minor concerns and he will allow his body to be ravaged by boils, lice
and lesions while devoting his life to meditation.
Cast off the burdens of society – The path of the anchorite is a lonely
one. Society is a poison to the seeker of self-realisation, its rigid norms,
expectations and its empty distractions a trap to lure away the weak of
mind.
Adventure Seeds
Disposable Wealth: Rumour has it that somewhere in the Borderlands
there is an anchorite who has stumbled upon the location of an ancient
Dwarf treasure vault. If he could be found, he might be willing to
impart this information (having no interest in material wealth himself)
to a suitably enlightened soul.
Picking Up the Pieces: The Baron of Deepvale was deposed many
years ago, his realm broken up and claimed by other border princes.
Now, however, some of his loyal followers seek to restore the baron to
power. Unfortunately for them, the baron has become an anchorite and
is living somewhere in the wastes, so they must find him and somehow
convince him to reclaim his barony.

Animal Trainer
Behold, gentlemen! This beast is less ferocious than an old crone. Watch as I insert my entire foot
into the dancing bear’s mouth...wait...no Vinny! Stop...urk!
(New) Animal trainers breed and train animals for transport, hunting or entertainment.
Their most common job is breeding riding horses and destriers for the horse markets,
but animal trainers are also skilled dog and bird handlers that accompany nobles’
hunting parties. Carnivals employ animal trainers as ringmasters to delight the masses
with dancing bears and prancing ponies. Animal trainers can also serve the role of
beast handlers in pit fighting arenas, though little effort is expended training the ornery
fighting animals that were originally captured in the wild. Though Kislevite bear
tamers are famous for their ability to train wild bears, most trained animals are born in
captivity.

Reward and Coercion
Animal training is done in three stages: breaking, domination and
training. The basic techniques for mentally breaking an animal rely on
either reward or coercion. Reward-based breaking exploits the animal’s
instinctive need for food or shelter to establish programmed responses.
Coercion involves breaking the animal’s will with the lash of a whip
until it responds predictably to the slightest flick. Most trainers use a
combination of reward and coercion. Domination means convincing the
animal to accept physical restraint by the use of hood, cage or harness.
Breaking and domination must be finished before actual training can
begin. Occasionally animals are discovered to be untrainable during this
early period; even those raised from birth.
Training Animals
Once breaking and domination are complete, the trainer can begin
teaching specific tricks. The number of successful skill tests required to
teach each trick is determined by its Trick Difficulty (for the Animal
Training skill, see WFRP pg. 91). Animals captured in the wild are
limited in their ability to override instincts, and therefore cannot learn
more tricks than the number indicated below. Animals trained from
birth can learn any number of tricks.
Dog or Bear: Simple tricks include Sit, Stay and Come. Moderate
tricks are Attack, Fetch and Restrain. Teaching dogs and bears to
perform carnival tricks is a Difficult task. Feral dogs and bears are
limited to 3 tricks.

Captured birds of prey can only be taught 1 trick.
Pigeon: Delivering messages up to 1o miles is a Simple trick.
Delivering 11-100 miles is a Moderate trick and destinations 101-500
miles away count as Difficult tricks. Each individual destination is
taught as a separate trick and wild pigeons can only learn 1 destination.
Ferret or Cat: Basic tricks like Sit, Stay and Come are considered
Moderate for these ornery animals. Attack and Fetch count as Difficult
tricks. Feral cats and ferrets may only learn 2 tricks.

Anointed Priest
Reveal to me the deeper mysteries of my faith, oh wise Verena, that I may serve you better.
(Core) A priest who has consistently upheld the tenets of his church is chosen by his God to
take on greater power and responsibility. Anointed Priests are gifted with the Divine Lore of the
deity they serve and consequently, they’re expected to take on challenges suitable to their new
blessings. They often have all the attributes that their God admires, acting as beacons of faith
to others in the Old World. Anointed Priests are greatly trusted by the common folk, who will
often listen to them over both Nobles and Politicians, granting them a great deal of temporal
power to complement the spiritual.

Little Known Facts
Though anointed priests usually rise from within the church, this is
not always the case. The gods choose their representatives based on
faith and obedience rather than prior service. In certain notable cases,
a devout follower has been chosen as an anointed priest without any
previous experience serving in the church. The churches frown upon
such incidents but cannot gainsay their gods, and in many cases those
anointed priests have gone on to become figures of legend.
Most anointed priests take on as many of their god’s characteristics and
habits as possible – they begin to dress as the god dresses, wield the
god’s preferred weapons, eat the god’s favourite dishes, etc. Some claim
this is merely an affectation. Others say it is a direct result of the god’s
hand on the anointed priest, and is not a matter of choice.
Anointed priests often find themselves unable to ignore an affront to
their god, whether it is a direct insult or a slight toward something the
god holds dear. In the same way, anointed priests cannot resist aiding
and protecting those the god values, and demeaning those the god
hates.
Notable Figures
Rolf Waterbreather is one of those rare cases, an anointed priest with
no prior church training. A sailor by occupation, Rolf was well-known
among mariners for his skill and his stamina. More than once, he was
the only man left standing when a storm struck the ship and tossed the
crew about, and more than once his steady hand on the wheel was all
that kept the ship safe.
His peers considered him touched by Manann, and the Sea God
evidentially agreed. He came to Rolf in a dream, praising him and
offering him a role as Manann’s earthly representative. Awed, Rolf
agreed. The next morning he awoke to find a black iron circlet on his
head and a heavy trident at his side, the symbols of his new calling.
From that point on Rolf roamed the seas, moving from ship to ship and
port to port, protecting the ships and their crews from storms, raiders,
and monsters. He was last seen battling a tentacled behemoth that had
devoured an entire war galley. Man and monster sank beneath the waves
together, Rolf wrapped in its tentacles and his trident imbedded in the
beast’s massive eye.
Many sailors believe Rolf survived and will return to once more take up
the duties of his god.
Adventure Seeds
An Unsavory Suitor: The anointed priest spies a young woman
bearing the sign of his god. She appears to be in distress, and when
approached admits that she is being pursued by a man intent upon
marrying or despoiling her. The anointed priest cannot refuse aid to
a follower of his god, though this involves him in a dispute far more
complicated than it first appeared.
Against His Will: The task the party has been called upon or hired to
undertake involves elements repugnant to on the party member’s god.
The character cannot participate in those elements, and must do his best
to dissuade the others from them as well, suggesting alternate plans and
using every means necessary to block those activities.

(SH) While physicians prescribe cures for their patients’ various ills, it is the apothecary
who actually makes the medicine. Specialists in minerals, chemicals, and salts derived from
organic matter, the apothecary mixes powders to be taken with wine, unguents to apply
to infected areas, and medicinal incenses to drive away unhealthy vapours. Guild law allows
them to prescribe for minor ailments, such as a cold or stomach-ache, but few do since many
physicians are resentful of the competition. While some apothecaries move on to higher careers
in medicine or academia, others turn their knowledge to personal greed or succumb to a desire to
harm others. Some apothecaries have been known to feed their clients drugs disguised as medicine, forcing
them to come back and pay higher prices to feed their addiction, while others sell their services as
poisoners, splitting the profits with an aggrieved widow or heir.

Affiliations
The Apothecary’s Guild is one of the weaker guilds in the Old World,
under constant pressure by the more powerful Physician’s Guild. For
fees much lower than a surgeon charges, apothecaries will attempt to
cure their patients by manipulating the body’s four vital humours with
chemical compounds. The Physician’s Guild counters the competitive
edge of the apothecaries by forcing them to sell their wares to physicians
at a significant discount. The order of Gold Wizards also watches
apothecaries’ shops to ensure they aren’t dabbling in higher alchemy.
Consequentially, some apothecaries supplement their meagre income
by selling illegal drugs and poisons. An apothecary caught doing this
faces expulsion from the guild in addition to criminal charges. However,
many wealthy and influential customers use these black market
products, and a threat or bribe from one of them can convince the
Apothecary’s Guild to overlook legal transgressions by its members.
Apothecaries are respected by the priesthood of Shallya, who support
affordable medicine for all. Unfortunately, this goodwill rarely translates
into political influence because the cult of Shallya is disinclined to
challenge the Physician’s Guild. Needless to say, many apothecaries
pursue higher academic studies in their spare time, hoping to eventually
obtain membership in both guilds.
Preparation Techniques
The apothecary trade is filled with all manner of unusual means to
prepare components for their tinctures and potions. Apothecaries have
their own terms to explain the complex processes they undertake in
their craft.
Concoction: Mixture is heated or cooked at moderate heat for an
extended period.
Desiccation: Substance is dried or heated to remove all moisture.
Elixiration: Mixture is converted into a potion or draught.
Imbibition: A procedure is extended by the gradual and continuous
addition of a substance.
Luting: A flask or jar is sealed airtight using a waxy paste.
Putrefaction: Ingredient is rotted under gradual, moist heat.
Sublimation: Solid ingredient is heated, producing a vapour that
condenses on the inside of a flask.
Trituration: Ingredient is reduced to powder by applying heat.
Adventure Seeds
Ancient Elixirs: While researching Arabyan herbs, the apothecary
stumbles upon a historical reference hinting at the location of a
Nehekharan prince’s tomb. Even more interesting than the potential
loot is the suggestion that the prince’s court alchemist had discovered an
elixir of transmutation. Perhaps the elixir’s formula was buried with the
prince, or the tomb contains a clue about its location.
Toxic Trade: The Apothecary’s Guild holds more influence than
usual due to the shortage of licensed physicians in town. Now, the
apothecaries are making great profits selling addictive remedies to the
townsfolk. But a conspiracy among the guild’s inner council pushes the
game too far, when toxic agents are added to the formula to perpetuate
the customers’ maladies. Will anyone squeal?

Apprentice Runesmith
In another fifty years, perhaps I will have perfected this simple rune so I can learn deeper mysteries.
(RoS) The Runesmiths are effectively a clan containing a few ancient families who have passed down
the knowledge and skills of Runesmithing over the generations. Each Master Runesmith teaches the
fundamentals of fire and forge to young members of his family, selecting the most talented to
become Apprentice Runesmiths. While selection is a great honour, it means long years of study
and service to his master in the creation of more complicated runes. Runesmiths rarely write
down the secrets of their craft and even when they do, the knowledge is buried beneath riddles
and puzzles. Apprentices must be patient, clever, and perceptive to rise in status. During this
time Apprentice Runesmiths often leave the service of their mentor to gather ingredients,
tools, and supplies for the forging of new runes.
Note: Only Dwarfs can enter this career. If you are rolling randomly for your
Starting Career, you can substitute Apprentice Runesmith for Scribe with your GM’s

A Day in the Life
While the life of a runesmith is not an easy one, apprentices in this
ancient craft have it slightly better than many other young trainees –
they are carrying on a great family tradition and have been chosen due
to merit.
They must perform the same scut work as any apprentice, but all of it
serves a purpose besides the master vicariously paying back his own hard
student years. Everything is a lesson, and if the apprentice doesn’t see
the lesson at once, he must puzzle it out, and as he does so, he learns
more and more. The seemingly menial task of kneading dough might
temper the wrists for carving steel.
The laborious copying of dull books of mining records teaches the way
to precisely and perfectly form characters. The repairing of a broken
clockwork device shows how parts relate to a whole, how to bring magic
into what is otherwise a simple symbol. Without the proper training
and understanding, a rune is worthless; a human smith could copy a
rune exactly and it would perform no magic at all, because he doesn’t
understand it the way a dwarf does. The map is the territory; the rune is
the power it symbolises.
Little Known Facts
The greatest day in an apprentice’s life is when he is trusted with his
First Carving, when he is given the tools and the blade and told to
inscribe a rune upon it “for real”, not for practise or training. The blade
he makes will be given to a member of his own family for use in battle,
and how that battle fares is considered to be an omen.
If the wielder of the First Carving triumphs, or even dies while helping
the dwarfs to victory, it is considered a positive sign; if an enemy
captures the blade, it is a sign of ill omen.
At times, runesmith bloodlines grow thin, especially after a major
invasion by orcs. During these rare events – perhaps once a century
–runesmith families will seek to adopt dwarfs from other clans. There
are many competitions of lore, skill and courage, but a handful will be
chosen, and will abandon all claim on their own heritage and be fully
accepted as part of the rune workers’ family.
Adventure Seeds
 The Riddle Of The Rune: An apprentice runesmith, on a voyage to
a nearby human village, hears a minstrel singing a song which happens
to contain, amongst the seemingly nonsensical lyrics, some of the coded
symbolic knowledge of the runesmiths. It is not a dwarf song that the
bard has learned, but one of seeming human origin. How did he come
to learn it? The runesmith is concerned that dwarf lore is somehow
spreading among humans, and if so, this must be stopped.
Under A New Master: During what should be a routine journey,
orcs set upon an apprentice runesmith and his master. The master dies
while giving his apprentice a chance to flee, but not before he tells him
to journey to a far-off dwarf hold where a new teacher awaits. This
is a great way for a PC apprentice runesmith to begin adventuring.
Alternatively, the characters could be hired to guide or guard the
apprentice on his journey.

A Day in the Life
 In the months that follow, these young girls are trained in the ways of
Ice Magic just as the Khan Queens have been for countless generations.
They are taught to survive the cold winters in the Oblast while they
mature and grow cold themselves.
Much of their daily routine involves tasks geared towards survival,
like gathering firewood and setting snares to capture wild game, with
the rest of their waking hours devoted to the practice and study of Ice
Magic. Many do not survive this training under such harsh conditions,
but those who do become protectors of the land and its people, and a
force to be reckoned with.
Some apprentices find the challenges inherent in being an Ice Maiden
too daunting and too lonely. Many of these use their knowledge to help
others without embracing the solitary path of a Maiden of the Ice.
For those who remain steadfast and determined in the face of the
countless challenges, however, the rewards can be significant. The
prospect of unlocking further mysteries is certainly apparent, but not to
be overlooked is the surge of self-confidence and growing awareness and
acceptance of one’s abilities and personal limitations.
Little Known Facts
Upon completing their initial training and earning their release from
their mistresses, the former Apprentice’s eyes turn an icy shade of
blue, -- almost overnight. No matter their former complexion, upon
completion of their apprenticeship, the soon-to-be ice maiden’s skin
adopts an almost translucent paleness, and is slightly chilled to the
touch.
It is rumoured that an apprentice witch, on the first anniversary of her
selection for her apprenticeship, must break a hole in the ice of a frozen
lake without the aid of tools and plunge in. The apprentice must then
survive the night out of doors, still wet, with only a thin blanket as a
shield against the elements. Since neither apprentices, ice maidens nor
ice witches will discuss about this ritual except amongst themselves, its
veracity has never been confirmed.
Adventure Seeds
A Cold Calling: The party is sent by one of the Electors on a mission
within Kislev. The guide provided for them is a teenage girl dressed in
furs and skins, cold, aloof, and not very talkative. The party is unlikely
to think much of her until trouble finds them, and she demonstrates her
Ice Magic to get them out of a tight spot.
A Threat to All: An apprentice witch, bedraggled and half-alive,
appears on the doorstep where the party is staying. She seeks help from
any and all who are willing. A wizard loyal to the dark lord Tzeentch
is attempting to capture ice witches and turn them to the worship of
Tzeentch to corrupt Ice Magic forever. She was sent to warn the Empire
and to seek aid from outside, for none within the realm of Kislev would
dare raise a hand against an ice witch, even if she had become a follower
of one of the proscribed cults.
Which Witch? Two young girls have shown promise in the frigid
arts of the Ice Witches. However, the village seer is convinced one
is a fraud – in fact, a meddlesome spirit seeking to sow discord and
mistrust amongst the villagers. Can the characters determine which
young girl is destined to become an Ice Maiden, and rid the village of
the pesky spirit?

(Core) Humans born with magical talent are dangerous and feared individuals. Daemons and
disaster gather about an untrained Wizard. To deal with this threat the Empire sends such
people away to join one of the eight Orders of Wizardry. During their apprenticeship young

others adventure to garner enough money to pay for their tutelage at the Colleges of Magic.
Elves are naturally magical, and do not need to attend these Human institutions, learning from

A Day in the Life
It isn’t easy mastering magic – of those few with even a hint of the
gift, fewer still manage to tame it and control it before it consumes
them (or just gets them burned by an angry mob). Apprenticeship is
often gruelling, demeaning work, with the master handing out only
the smallest nuggets of real knowledge in payment for hours of tedious
labour. However, it’s the only even half-safe way to become a true
wizard.
An apprentice’s day begins early. There are candles to light, potions to
tend to, runes to scribe, and meals to prepare. Even if the master could
chop wood or skin chickens by magic, he prefers to let the apprentice
do it – both to keep him busy and to teach him not to call on magic
for trivial acts. Power must be respected! Over the course of the day,
the apprentice will help his master with his many tasks, sometimes
accompanying him as he meets other wizards or offers counsel to nobles
and merchants. At times, if the master is pleased, there will be formal
training in the art of magic, some genuine wisdom that makes the tiring
labour of the day seem almost worth it.
Some apprentices leave before their training is complete – their master
perished in some disaster and they barely escaped, or there was just one
beating too many. Such individuals, with only the barest grasp on their
gifts, can parley their limited powers into enough coin to pay for further
training, or just learn as they travel, which can be dangerous to both
themselves and their companions.
Affiliations
Apprentices have only the most limited status in guilds or academies,
but wherever many wizards gather together, their apprentices will
likewise gather. They form loose-knit gangs, part study circle, part
drinking club, part collection of backstabbing betrayers. The path from
apprentice to full wizard is not easy, and while it’s good to have the help
of one’s fellows, they also represent competition.
Such gangs rarely last long, but they can provide good contacts or
connections once Apprenticeship is past. A typical conversation among
former apprentices can often go something like this:
 “Remember how you and me and Darryl used to all drink together at
the Butchered Sow? Whatever happened to old Darryl, anyway? Eaten
by a deamon? Damn, that’s too bad. Anyway, I’ve got a favour to ask...”
Adventure Seeds
Return Of The Master: An apprentice wizard (a member or friend
of the party) who has claimed to be a freelancer, is surprised to find
his master – the one he said died in a mysterious fire – alive, well, and
angrily looking for his former student. Was the ‘death’ story all a lie to
cover up an apprentice running away? Is this an imposter, hunting the
student for unknown reasons? Or did he survive the flames and now
believes the student was responsible for his near death? The wizard
doesn’t seem too inclined to sit down for an explaination.
The Final Lesson: An arrogant but talented young apprentice has
nearly completed his studies and has been sent on a complex errand
that requires him to test his skills to the utmost. Or so he has been
told. In reality, it’s a complex prank by his master to teach him humility.
Unfortunately, something has gone horribly wrong. The embarrassing
curse of boils and flatulence the ritual was supposed to create has instead
summoned a foul-smelling daemon, covered in boils and rupturing
pustules. The master was overwhelmed by the daemon, which now waits
for the apprentice...and anyone who might be travelling with him.

Artillerist
Wot? Wot? You’ll have to speak louder, lad? The cannons are barkin’ fierce today.
(WC) The Artillerist is skilled at operating all manner of siege weapons, from the ballista to
the trebuchet, and even gunpowder devices like the cannon, mortar and Hellblaster Volley Gun
of the Imperial arsenal. Field repairs are often necessary when a wheel breaks
or a gun carriage cracks, and a smart Artillerist quickly learns how to make
temporary repairs to ensure minimal interruption in firing rate. Artillerists rely
on teamwork and command groups of Engineers to operate their weapons
effectively. They are rarely found outside of a large army.
Part engineer, part soldier, and all target, Artillerists must learn to take care
of themselves on the battlefield. Generally they are far enough behind the
battle lines to be out of danger, but the effectiveness of their weaponry makes
them favourite targets for enemy missile fire, flying creatures, and magical
attacks. Also, moving the various engines around is hard work under the
best of conditions; over muddy, rutted, rock-strewn battlefields it can be
an endurance test with lives hanging in the balance. The career of an
Artillerist is not all glory, as is frequently supposed.

Trust in Sigmar but Keep Your Powder Dry
An artillerist lives and dies on the battlefield by his skill in operating
and maintaining his gun. Because of this, an artillerist is taught to put
nothing above the care of his gun. He obsessively cleans and maintains
it, practices often and polishes it until it shines. Some artillerists go so
far as to give their guns female names and talk or even sing to them.
This has led to most state troop regiments regarding artillerists as more
than a little strange. Of course, as long as the big guns keep firing, they
are not going to complain.
Imperial Artillery
The Empire is well known throughout the Old World for using blackpowder
artillery in its armies. Here is a look at two iconic field pieces
in the Empire’s arsenal – the Imperial Great Cannon and the fearsome,
experimental Helblaster Volley Gun.
Imperial Great Cannon
Any artillerist worth his powder will proudly claim tht the Imperial
great cannons are easily the largest and most powerful artillery in the
Old World, outclassing even the cannons of the Dwarfs. While not the
most reliable or accurate weapon, a direct hit from a great cannon will
blow most things into tiny pieces.
Helblaster Volley Gun
A relatively new innovation, the volley gun can lay down a
withering hail of shot in a very short time. Though slow to reload
and cumbersome to move, these factors are a minor inconvenience
compared to the bloody carnage the gun can cause.
Special: When firing the Helblaster Volley Gun, roll 1d10. This is the
number of shots fired this turn. Roll to hit for each shot individually.
Shots can be divided among multiple targets as long as all targets are
within 6 yards of each other. The gun needs to be reloaded after it has
fired nine times.
Adventure Seeds
Fire in the Hole: A new weapon turned out by the Imperial Engineers’
School, Fredric’s Flame-Projector of Fearsome Fiery Death, needs a
brave artillerist to test its capabilities. If it works, it is sure to attract
other interested parties.
Bell Ringer: While resting at camp, the artillerists of Baron Hessal’s
Nordland border regiment have decided to alleviate their boredom by
engaging in a little competition. They wager which of them can hit the
temple bell of a nearby town with their cannons. Unfortunately as the
temple is actually across the border in Middenland, such action could
carry more serious consequences than a damaged belfry!

(Core) Artisans are skilled craftsmen and masters of their trades. Most commonly found in towns and cities,
Artisans are organized into a bewildering variety of guilds. The best craftsmen are attracted to the largest cities,
such as Altdorf, Marienburg and Nuln. There they can command high prices from the richest clientele, or
work with Merchants who can sell their goods in more distant locales. Some Artisans are so famous that even
Nobles must put their names on waiting lists, for to have the work of a renowned master is sign of status.

The Artisans’ Guild
The Empire’s reputation for “superior Imperial craftsmanship” is largely
borne on the shoulders of the Artisans’ Guild. The Artisans’ Guild is an
exclusive body of elite artisans who establish and maintain the standards
of mastery in a given craft or trade. Long gone are the days of the lone
craftsman, toiling over a single job from start to finish. The modern
Imperial workshop features a revised distribution of labour, where
the crafting process is divided among teams of subordinate tradesmen
working under the supervision of a guild artisan.
Guild artisans see themselves as an elite class rather than mere producers
of trade and craft. Guild members gain access to patronage from a
higher rank of nobility than unguilded artisans, first rights to the most
visible and lucrative contracts, and set important trends that will be
followed by many. Surprisingly, admittance to the guild is a rather
uncomplicated two-stage affair. However, the application process can be
slow without the necessary resources or political connections.
The prospective artisan must first secure the sponsorship of three active
guild members in good standing. Guild members are only permitted to
sponsor one applicant per year, so this results in an elaborate courting
process in which the prospective artisan is expected to bestow lavish
gifts and favours upon his potential sponsors. Of course, most sponsors
are well aware of the lucrative benefits of guild membership, and seek to
extort the same pay-offs they paid as prospects themselves.
The second and more difficult requirement for membership is the
presentation and judgment of a masterwork representing the artisan’s
ability. The masterwork is judged by an assembly of artisans who are
experts in the applicant’s specific craft or trade. If the masterwork
is found wanting, the prospective tradesman may only reapply after
two years and must completely repeat the sponsorship process. If the
assembly accept the masterwork, they present the applicant with his
guild ring and welcome him as a new brother.
It’s important to note that the Artisans’ Guild is not a trade guild
in the traditional sense, and has no financial stake or authority over
any other trade or craft guild. The Artisans’ Guild is a place where
the accomplished masters of craft meet to work, play and debate the
important topics of the day. The only commodity traded at the Artisans’
Guild is influence.
The Masterwork (Special Rule)
The masterwork is a crafting project that demonstrates the Artisan’s
“mastery” of the fabrication process and history of his trade or craft.
The masterwork is physical proof of the artisan’s successful quest for
knowledge in his chosen discipline, be it painting, sword-crafting or
brewing.
An artisan wishing to craft his own masterwork can attempt to do so by
succeeding at a Hard (-20) Trade Test. The masterwork must be crafted
in full view of the judges, although the artisan does all the work and
research himself. Quality components are an asset, and a character may
add 5% to his Trade Test for each 250 gold he invests in the work.

Assassin
You have but to whisper the name and pay the gold. He will be dead by week’s end.
(Core) Killing for money is not unusual in the Old World. Soldiers and Mercenaries
do it every day. Few sell swords achieve the Assassin’s level of lethality, however. These
hired killers are expertly trained and deadly with a variety of weapons. Many also
master the poisoner’s art. The best Assassins can dispatch their targets in a matter of
seconds, leaving behind no evidence of their presence. Their services are much sought
after by political and even religious bodies. Few Assassins care where the commissions
come from. They only want a challenging mission and a fat purse for their fee. While
most Assassins are loners, a rare few have organized into guilds.

A Day in the Life
The first thing an assassin does once he accepts a job is study the target.
He wakes early and sets himself in a vantage point near the target’s
home, finding a place where he can watch without drawing attention
to himself. Many assassins have enough skills in a craft, so they can
pretend to be cobblers, tinkers, or street-sweepers and work at such tasks
as a cover. The assassin watches everything as he works, taking note of
the people passing by, the entrances and exits from the target’s residence,
and possible weak points in the target’s potential defense.
Once the target emerges, the assassin shadows him, staying close enough
to watch but far enough away that he won’t be noticed. He watches
the target throughout the day, noting everywhere he goes and everyone
he meets. Every activity is evaluated with an eye toward the job. Does
the target lunch at a particular pub where his food could be poisoned?
Does he take a shortcut through a dark alley where he could be stabbed
unnoticed? Is he fond of touring the docks or the warehouses, where a
carefully engineered “accident” might cause his demise?
Whenever the target settles into a location, the assassin takes the
opportunity to widen his scrutiny, examining every detail of the locale.
He works out strategies to approach and exit each place unseen and
unobstructed. A good assassin will study a subject for days, possibly
weeks, before finally making his move.
Affiliations
Most assassins prefer to work alone – it is easier to kill alone than
coordinate with others, and a solo assassin does not have to split his fee.
That does not mean assassins work completely independently, however.
In fact, most successful assassins have a wide support network.
First, and most important, are their contacts. A good assassin is one
whose true name and face are never known by the client, or by people
in general. Assassins often create colourful working names to disguise
their true identity, but someone still has to know who they really are
(or at least how to reach them). A good, reliable contact can make
an assassin’s life far easier, making first contact with potential clients
and possibly handling the meetings altogether. Contacts get a share of
each commission, so it is in their own best interest to get the assassin
frequent work and substantial payments.
Assassins rely heavily on their equipment, and for many that means they
need someone to create or care for such tools. Since different assassins
prefer different methods, this can mean an apothecary for poisons, a
blacksmith for bladed weapons, a gunsmith for blackpowder weapons,
or several other skilled craftsmen. The ideal equipper is not only
talented but discreet.
Some assassins work in a guild, though this is usually only in the largest
cities. The guild’s three principle functions are as a contact point, an
equipping station, and a staging area. The third is crucial – assassins
report each job they accept and a guild officer makes sure there are
no overlaps or complications. This allows the assassin to work more
freely, knowing he will not have direct competition once a job has
been assigned. He also knows he has a place he can go to if he needs
additional resources, more information, or a safe place to hide.
Adventure Seeds
Spilling His Guts: The city guards arrested someone the assassin has

Astrologer
The star sign of Dragomas the Drake aligns with Mammit the Wise. Mannslieb is ascendant and fully
revealed. Such portents are auspicious indeed, my lord. Now, concerning the matter of my payment…
(SH) The future is a frightening thing for many people: war, the threat of chaos, disease,
financial ruin, and betrayal – there is so much to worry about. People have many questions
about the future, and the astrologer is there to supply the answers, whether or not she knows
what she is talking about. Surrounded by star charts and arcane equipment, the astrologer seeks
answers by charting the motions and relative positions of the planets in the heavens. Some are
genuinely talented and try to do their best, while others are little better than fakers who tell their
clients whatever they want to hear. Nobles and other powerful people are suspicious of those who
can tell their future and zealously guard the time of their births. To cast the horoscope of a ruler
without permission is considered treason, and many an astrologer has had to make a hasty exit
after just trying to satisfy their curiosity.

The Importance of Star Signs
 A character may visit an astrologer to have his fortune read. Be
warned – knowing one’s future rarely brings happiness. Once the
astrologer’s palm has been crossed with silver, he will consult his
star charts. An astrologer will need to know the character’s star sign
before a reading can begin (see WFRP page 25). If the astrologer
makes a successful Academic Knowledge (Astronomy) test, he
correctly foretells the future. The GM rolls 1d10 on the table
below. If the astrologer fails the test, he simply bluffs an answer.
1: I Foresee Tragedy! One future die roll (at the GM’s discretion)
will automatically fail (or result in the worst possible result). This
cannot be re-rolled using Fortune Points.
2-4: Dark Omens. The PC receives a –10% penalty for 1d10 days
to a statistic or Skill relating to his star sign (GM’s choice).
5-6: The Signs are Obscured. There is no effect.
7-9: Glad Tidings. The PC receives a +10% bonus for 1d10 days
to a statistic or Skill relating to his star sign (GM’s choice).
10: Now is Your Time! The character gains 3 Fortune Points for the
next 24 hours. If not used, these Fortune Points are lost.
A character can only benefit or suffer from one result at a time. A
character can only roll on this table once per month. If a character
tries to have his fortune read before the month is out, he will
“offend the stars” and suffers the I Foresee Tragedy! result as a
consequence.
The Order of Acilius Stargazer
This bizarre little brotherhood is a collection of astrologers, priests,
scholars and wizards who believe that the ancient scholar, Acilius
Geminus, is the greatest prophet of this age. Acilius wrote a book
entitled “Via Astra” – literally “By Way of the Stars”. Within this lurid
little tome, Acilius laid out detailed charts and timelines using his
theories of stellar motion and astrological omens. He was not content
to simply predict the recent future. Instead his timeline stretches several
thousand years forward. Each year has a corresponding cryptic quatrain.
The Order is convinced that these are the key to understanding the
future. This year’s quatrain (translated from Classical) reads thusly:
First the ice falls and then the snow
In hallowed halls, a prince laid low
Cloth’d in shadow, the betrayer reigns
A city of sorrow, the lion is slain
Whether there is any truth to these predictions is an open question.
Most are vague and easily applied to a myriad of circumstances, but the
Order is convinced and has managed to sway some bored nobility to
their beliefs.
Adventure Seeds
Daemonic Destiny? A rather unstable astrologer and member of the
Order of Acilius Stargazer decides that this year’s quatrain reveals that
a particular noble has been replaced by a daemon. He discovers that
the noble has a regular clandestine meeting with a mistress, and hires
a group of adventurers to serve as his assassins, claiming that the noble
has been possessed. Of course, if the adventures actually carry out the
astrologer’s scheme, they are going to be in a lot of trouble.

Ataman
Let us gather as a community and celebrate the ties that bind us together.
(RotIQ) Most oblast communities are led by atamans (female: atamankas). Gospodar atamans are
normally druzhina whose families have ruled locally for generations. By comparison, most Ungols
elect their atamans or select them according to obscure (often martial) traditions, for most of their
noble bloodlines were wiped out by the Gospodars long ago. Atamans bear great responsibilities,
for all important local matters are decided by them, especially those concerning security and
law. Further, if there are no local priests, atamans also take on the responsibility for the spiritual
wellbeing of their people, leading religious rites and ceremonies.

Notable Figures
Bianca Ostovich is well known throughout the northern oblast as the
fearsome atamankas of Petrev. A huge woman she towers over many
men, especially when wrapped in her ceremonial furs, great silver bulava
gripped in one hand.
Descended from the wild horsemen of the north she is one of the
few female Ungol atamans, a testament to her resilience and strength.
Scornful of weak southerners, Empire folk and Gospodars alike, she has
little time for outsiders. Within Petrev and its surrounds she rules with
an iron fist, often helping out the atamans of nearby villages should they
be in need. As a result many of the Ungol tribes are in Bianca’s debt.
As tough as any man, and a measure tougher than many, it is said she
can trace her linage back to the Great War against Chaos when her
ancestors fought to free the north of the taint of corruption. As proof
of this her great hall is adorned with the weathered skulls of strange
and twisted creatures, purportedly beasts slain by her ancestors. Bianca
however tends to favour more simple trophies for herself and carries a
bag of teeth at her belt, donated from unruly villages and enemies alike.
If someone looks like they are getting out of line she rattles her toothbag
in warning, which is usually enough to make them behave.
Responsibilities
An ataman is responsible for more than just the safety and well being of
their village. They must also preside over many of the daily activities of
their people. It is said on the oblast that if it is important to the village
then it is important to the ataman.
Judgment: Frequently an ataman must act as judge and jury for his
people. Determining guilt and dishing out punishment. This is where
a good knowledge of his people is vital, so that he might weight the
person’s worth against the crime. This is why it is always a good idea to
stay on the ataman’s good side.
Ceremonies: An ataman is always present and sometimes involved in all
naming days, marriages and funerals within his village. Though if there
is a priest on hand they will usually perform the ceremony it is up to the
ataman to make sure it all runs smoothly. Such is an ataman’s influence
that few within his village will consider a marriage without his blessing.
The Hunt – At the start of each year it is considered a mark of great
fortune for the ataman to lead the village’s hunters. The honour of the
first years kill then falls to him and many within the village believe that
the animal brought back by the ataman says much about what the new
year has in store.
Adventure Seeds
Dark Leadership: Koris, the ataman of the village of Slavich, has
been revealed as a worshipper of dark powers. Even with this terrible
revelation none within the village dare move against him as he is still

with the evil ataman for them.
United Cause: News is spreading of a great horde of Chaos poised to
rampage across the northern oblast. The Ice Queen knows however that
the Ungol atamans of that region are fiercely divided. She is looking for
someone to travel to the north and try and unite the atamans before it
is too late.

Badlander
Life’s tough here, so we’re tougher. The only hope here is the dream of leaving these rocks behind.
(RC) Badlanders, as the name suggests, live in the badlands of the Border Princes. These areas are often mazes of broken rock, containing little water and
less life, and what life is present is unpalatable at best and hostile at worst. They have to
travel constantly around the area to find food and water, which also makes it relatively
easy for them to hide. A surprisingly high proportion of Badlanders have previous
careers from which they are hiding; those who don’t tend to dream of doing
something worth hiding from.

Finding Forgiveness in the Badlands
The Badlands hold a life of unbelievable hardship compared to life in
the Empire. Living on the move in such harsh terrain forces the natives
to be hunters and gatherers of any potential food and water sources.
Where vagabonds might scavenge easily in a forest, badlanders must
scour rugged rock and sparse ravines for the well-hidden edible plants or
sheltered sources of water.
Because of these hardships, enduring the Badlands is a suitable
punishment for those incurring a god’s wrath. The length of
one’s sentence when exiled to the Badlands depends on his or her
transgression, though a typical sentence is “his years in days and one,
to prove his piety outweighs his maturity.” Many penitents die in the
Badlands before completing their contrition due to their inability to
find easy food, water, or shelter (or because they fall afoul of the native
Badlanders).
Beatrix “Crow’s Daughter”
While many people with questionable natures flee to the Badlands to
hide from the consequences of previous actions, some are born into the
rough life “between the mountains.” Beatrix knows little more than the
struggles for life among the stone labyrinths.
Raised by Bretonnian and Averlander deserters, Beatrix has lived among
the Badlands her entire life. The only evidence of her parentage is her
much-pitted Bretonnian dagger, with a crow’s head and wings for its
quillons. She remembers only that her father was a strong, fierce fighter
whenever outsiders entered “his” claimed territory, and her mother
could make the worst stews palatable with her knowledge of herbs.
Now, as an adult, Beatrix wonders what life is like beyond the stone
canyons and desolation of her youth. She plans on finding out, once she
secures a bit more coin and a reliable map of the Empire.
Adventure Seeds
Cat and Mouse: A great deal of money can be made by pursuing
deserters and criminals into the Badlands and bringing them back to
civilization and justice. However, many bounty hunters bring half of
their fees with them into the Badlands, where they become victims of
those they hunt. The party can come in on either side of this, seeking
either to hide among the Badlands or root out those who do so.
Threats from the North: Badlanders don’t band together often except
to drive out those who menace all of them. Such are the threats out of
the World’s Edge mountains – ghouls, goblins, orcs, beastmen, or the
Chaos cults of the southern Empire. All prey on Badlanders for food,
as they are easier and more succulent prey than the usual rock lizards
and goats. The party can easily win favor within the Empire by hunting
down these Chaos threats, beyond the usual reach of Imperial law.
A Rugged Proposition: A former criminal approaches the party with
a proposition. On his most recent prison stay, the man had the good
fortune to share a cell with a badlander who described an ancient crypt
hidden deep within the rugged borderlands. All he asks in exchange for
the information is an armed escort willing to brave the dangers of the
Border Princes and help him locate and explore the ruins.

A Day in the Life
When not acting as scouts or guides for others, badlands rangers spend
their days surviving. Gathering scarce food resources in the Border
Princes is hard enough; avoiding marauding packs of orcs, beastmen,
brigands or the armed forces of one of the many petty rulers of this land
tests them to the limit. Badlands rangers are tough, but have enough
common sense not to start a fight unless they know they’ll win it.
The Badlands are a wild and dangerous part of the Border Princes;
having a local guide familiar with its perils is essential for survival. A
badlands ranger can be of limitless value when trying to move into or
through the Border Princes without attracting undue attention.
The fees they charge for their services are steep, but there are few who
can guide a party safely through this inhospitable terrain. Woe to anyone
who resorts to threats to force a badlands ranger to perform a task he
does not wish to undertake; he will simply slip away quietly in the
middle of the night, leaving his employers to their justly deserved fate.
Affiliations
Badlands rangers tend to attract the company of those wanting to avoid
the eye of the law: smugglers, crime lords, hedge wizards and people on
the run from authority are likely to associate with badlands rangers as a
means to their goals.
Given a choice, rangers would prefer to associate with those who can
help them find paying work: innkeepers, border courtiers, bounty
hunters, messengers, scouts and smugglers all can provide regular work
or can act as a reference for the skills and abilities of a badlands ranger.
Naturally each such contact expects a generous finder’s fee to direct such
business to the ranger.
Perhaps one of the most intriguing jobs a badlands ranger is employed
to undertake is “smuggling” people into and out of the Border Princes.
With the constant intrigues and political upheavals, many a noble,
dignitary or diplomat will suddenly find himself displaced, and in need
of a quick departure.
Likewise, an enterprising rival may try to seize such an opportunity, and
look to employ someone who can help him insinuate himself into the
right place at the right time.

obligations to their lords. These duties make them deeply unpopular with the villagers,
particularly during the lean times. As the hated face of lordly imposition, Bailiffs are the

A Day in the Life
Being a bailiff is not an easy task. No one looks forward to seeing the
bailiff on any occassion - especially when taxes or rent are due. During
tax season, the bailiff can expect to work long, thankless days at his
lord’s many tasks. Rising early, a bailiff travels to the furthest outskirts to
collect tithes and taxes from the farmers working his lord’s lands.
As the day wears on, he winds his way back toward the manorhouse,
collecting his due from local merchants, shopkeepers or proprieters
renting space from the lord. His daily routine ends with him bringing
the collected monies to his lord or the lord’s steward to be applied to the
many expenses associated with managing the land.
While the bailiff may not be popular, the rents and taxes he collects
do not just sit idly to line his lord’s coffers; the lord’s buildings and
domain must be maintained, and his advisors, soldiers and retinue must
be compensated. And in times of need, it is often the lord’s coin that
replaces the village’s broken mill wheel or pays to dig a new well in the
village green for all to use.
But the bailiff earns no affection for his task. His is the face of avarice,
detached indifference and all such things the commoners despise about
their lord. Because of this, the bailiff may find himself subject to the
curses, tirades and challenges a commoner would not dare levy against
the lord.
After suffering from the spite of those he visits throughout the day,
the bailiff finds it difficult to relax. His occupation puts him in an
unenviable social position - the bailiff is generally reviled by the working
folk and will find himself unwelcome in the taverns and inns frequented
by the locals, yet he has no claim to nobility or the luxuries of life, so
often finds himself without peers with which to socialise.
Bailiffs in the City
While bailiffs may be most commonly found in the employ of a noble
lord or the burgher of a small community, it is not without precedent
to see bailiffs in service in larger cities such as Nuln or Altdorf. In these
cases, the bailiff often fufills a slightly different role.
Large cities are comprised of myriad organisations, guilds and unions,
each of which functions as a smaller community within the whole. It is
within these sub-divisions and specialised communities where a bailiff
finds his place in city life.
For example, a bailiff may be on the payroll of a local guild to make
regular rounds throughout the city proper and collect fees and dues
from its members, collect payments from organisations that rely on
the guild’s services, parcel out expenditures on behalf of the guild’s
leadership or all manner of similar tasks and responsibilities.
Adventure Seeds
An Unwelcome Task: The bailiff’s employer is having difficulty
covering unforseen expenses stemming from an especially harsh winter.
He decides to impose a new tax on the local farmers, assessing them two
brass pennies per acre for any fallow or untilled fields, and the bailiff
has the honour of both informing the farmers of the new tax, as well as
collecting it immediately.
Local Unrest: The local populace chooses to express its outrage at the
high cost of rent in their district by threatening to abandon the lord’s
domain and moving to a neighbouring rival’s lands. The lord is furious
and sends the bailiff to substantiate these threats, as well as identify the
people behind this little insurrection and “deal with them.”

Barber Surgeon
This won’t hurt a bit. Before I start, though, you may want to bite down on this leather strop.
(Core) Barber Surgeons provide painful but effective healing to the common folk of the Empire.
They are not as learned as Physicians, which is why Physicians maintain a separate guild, but they
know quite a lot about anatomy. While they do cut hair and shave, they are more noted for their
bleedings, surgeries, and amputations. Barber Surgeons carry a variety of razor-sharp blades, from
small scalpels to enormous bone saws. They have even more sinister looking tools for the most hated
of their avocations: dentistry. Many large ships have a dedicated Barber Surgeon as part of the crew;
they are also common in towns and cities.

Affiliations
Barber Surgeons are closely regulated by their guilds, that are, in turn,
regulated by the local authorities. When you consider that barbersurgeons
hold razors to the throats of honest citizens on a daily basis,
this is easy to understand. In many places, practising as a Barber Surgeon
without guild authorisation counts as assault with a weapon, a crime
that often carries the death penalty. This makes expulsion from the
surgeons guild a very serious threatfor its members.
In most areas, the surgeon’s guild is tightly controlled by a small group
of families who carefully control admission into their circle. Some are
primarily interested in keeping competition down, and thus admit
very few new members. Others require ordinary members to pay a
very large portion of their income to the guild, and ultimately to the
controlling masters. Still others require members to pass on information
they hear while shaving, or the details of the injuries they are asked to
treat. Guilds that gather information may pass it on to the authorities,
organised crime, chaos cults, or all of the above.
The guild conditions mean that there is almost always demand for the
services of unguilded Barber Surgeons. They might be cheaper, or better
able to keep a secret. Guilds are active in hunting down these blacklegs
and turning them over to the authorities for punishment. However, in
some cases they might offer to allow them to continue operating, in
return for information.
Barber Surgeons must either deal with the guilds’ unreasonable
demands, or make sure that the guilds never discover them.
Little Known Facts
According to an Imperial decree of the time of Magnus the Pious,
any alleged physical mutation should be examined by an accredited
Barber Surgeon or physician, to confirm that it is not natural, before the
mutant is executed. The decree has never been repealed, but it is almost
always ignored, as the unnatural nature of most mutations is obvious.
Executing a mutant without an inspection is, however, still technically
illegal.
Most Barber Surgeons refuse to work when Morrslieb is full, saying that
the razor slips far too often when the Chaos Moon looks down.
Adventure Seeds
Never Mind How It Happened: The Barber Surgeon is asked to treat
a strange wound by someone who is evasive about where and how he
acquired it. A few days later, a different person asks for treatment for
an identical wound, and is just as vague about the cause. By the sixth
person with the same wound, even the most obtuse Barber Surgeon
would surely be getting a little curious.
Fatal Flamboyance: A local nobleman is renowned for his elaborate
hairstyles and, among Barber Surgeons, for the absurdly high fees he
pays his favoured barber. That fortunate individual dies in an accident,
and the nobleman announces a competition to find a successor. The
competition is supposed to be in hairstyling, but a surprising number
of the city’s Barber Surgeons suffer from accidents, some fatal. The fees
are reputed to be good, but really not good enough to kill for. What is
going on?

Battle Pilgrim
Milord bequeathed unto me this relic for my honored service. Failure to serve me, and
through me his Holiness, shall reveal what holy powers this gauntlet shall visit upon thy
sorry skull.
(KotG) Battle Pilgrims are Grail Pilgrims who have survived following their Grail
Knight for some time. As a result, they have become competent fighters. In most cases,
they have also become even more fervent admirers of their Grail Knight and worshippers
of the Lady of the Lake, having seen what the flower of Bretonnian chivalry is truly capable of.
Battle Pilgrims are the effective leaders of groups of Grail Pilgrims, as the Grail Knight never
condescends to give orders to peasant rabble. Some Grail Pilgrims resent taking orders from
someone no better than they, so Battle Pilgrims often have to impose order by force. Wiser Grail
Pilgrims note that their chances of survival are greatly increased by doing as the Battle Pilgrims say.

Tasks of Peace
In the simplest sense, battle pilgrims leads pilgrims into battle alongside
their Grail Knight, emboldening their brothers-in-arms. However,
a battle pilgrim must also protect his Grail Knight from the zealous
predations of his own followers. Grail pilgrims claim anything from
a discarded clout to bedstraw left after breaking camp. True battle
pilgrims keep such craven behaviour out of their lordship’s sight (and
punish those who usurp their rightful first refusal of such holy relics).
Battle pilgrims also have a host of mundane roles in their Grail Knight’s
service, such as ordering the breaking or making of camp, acting as a
knight’s aide or squire as needed, assigning followers to work as grooms
for any horses in the retinue and the like. One of the more bizarre roles,
however, is the privilege to bear the company’s reliquae – the corpse
of a Grail knight who fell in battle during his quest, carried along in a
decorated waincart. This is a fiercely contested honour, as the reliquae is
oft considered the ultimate symbol of their devotion and fidelity to the
Lady of the Lake.
Johann Novastus (Ulrike Stavonnus)
Born Ulrike Stavonnus in a tiny Carcassonne village, the daughter
of the village blacksmith was always a bit of a tomboy. Ulrike’s world
changed forever when a stranger stopped by her father’s forge. She fell
in love with Sir Paris de Marbleau at first sight. Sir Paris was a Grail
Knight, who needed his armour repaired. While her father was busy
repairing the knight’s breastplate, Sir Paris questioned him about local
pools, streams, and isolated glades in search of the Lady of the Lake.
Lovestruck, Ulrike made a hasty decision. She would follow Sir Paris
on his noble quest, and earn his love. Leaving behind the life of a
blacksmith’s daughter was easy. All it required was a hastily self-inflicted
haircut, a spear and a suit of slightly overlarge chainmail from her
father’s smithy. Soon the willowy Ulrike became the slender “Johann
Novastus,” grail pilgrim called to the quest. As Johann, she hurried after
her Sir Paris, following him on his quest. After realising he would never
be rid of the persistent lad, Sir Paris finally accepted Johann into his
service as squire and companion.
Johann’s utter devotion for his master convinced many of the knight’s
holy cause. By the end of their first year together, three other stalwart
followers joined their camp. Over the next four years, Johann saved
Sir Paris from two outlaw assassinations and numerous orc and goblin
ambushes as their Grail quest took them among the Vaults. His lord
gifted Johann his own personal chainmail after the duke of Artois gave
Paris a new suit of plate mail. Johann’s other secret treasure is a broken
knife he wears around his neck – it was abandoned by Sir Paris when it
broke against an orc’s breastbone.
Now a veteran battle pilgrim, Johann leads a motley group of other
devoted followers. Now in their third tour around Bretonnia, Johann
assures her fellow followers that Sir Paris shall see the Grail long before
they reach the northern Grey Mountains.

Knights to complete his reliquae, after which he believes the Lady of the
Lake shall grant him a vision and lead him to the Grail.

Bear Tamer
Me and Bruno, we like brothers… share same food, share same bed… what so funny, eh, Empire-man?
(RotIQ) The bear is sacred in Kislev. It features in the myths and legends of both tribes and
is venerated by the powerful Cult of Ursun. Bears are perceived as living embodiments of
the land’s enduring might and strength, and the struggles all Kislevites must endure.
Therefore, boyars often recruit bear tamers to support their armed forces, keeping
bears as inspiring mascots and sometimes for use in war. As Kislevites gather
in great numbers to see bears, bear trainers are also common in Kislev’s famous
circuses and on the streets during festival time, where they dance or show-wrestle
for coin.
If you are rolling randomly for your starting career and are not rolling a Kislevite, you
can substitute bear tamer for entertainer with your GM’s permission.

Trappings: Bear tamers find that a bit of armour goes a long way towards deflecting the claws of an unruly or grouchy bear and so most wear at least leather
jacks. As well, every bear tamer needs a collar and chain for his beast, and a whip or goad can’t hurt. A starting bear tamer must also have a bear, which he can
train over the course of his career.

Taming Ursun’s Children
As a mark of respect to Ursun, Kislevite bear tamers prefer their bears
companions to retain a spark of wildness, so they use bears captured in
the wild rather than those bred in captivity.
The hunt for young bears begins in spring, when the cubs born at
the end of winter emerge from their dens. The bear tamer joins the
hunt, along with a priest of Ursun to bless the hunters. A mother
bear is highly protective of her young, but killing her is prohibited, so
cunning is employed to snatch a cub. Dozens of hunters perish each
year, although there are many volunteers; it is a great honour to join a
successful hunt.
While the hunters stalk their prey, the priest leaves offerings of food
at the den to recompense the mother for her loss. In his prayers, he
promises that her cub will be treated as a prince in its new life among
humans.
A bear tamer regards a captured cub as his child. It undergoes a
naming ceremony at a temple of Ursun, and will feed from the family
table. When the bear grows to maturity, it is housed in a cage outside,
decorated with household trappings to make it feel at home.
The bear will be taught to dance or play-wrestle, skills that will attract
crowds at fairs and festivals. Popular bears can become celebrities, and
can earn their tamers a small fortune.
Although the bond between a tamer and his bear is strong, many a
tamer has been killed by an over-exuberant display of affection. A killer
bear is held in awe, its aggression seen as a gift from Ursun, and it is
transferred to the bear-pit of the god’s temple.
When a bear becomes too old to perform, its sorrowful trainer takes
it to a priest of Ursun for slaughter. The bear’s flesh is consumed at a
farewell meal, and its skin used for the family’s clothing. What cannot
be eaten is burnt at Ursun’s altar, so that the bear’s spirit can rejoin its
father.
Warbears of Kislev
Many bear tamers are associated with a temple of Ursun, where they
look after those bears consigned to the temple bear-pits on account of
their size and ferocity.
The bears’ aggressiveness is encouraged, although priests of Ursun and
bear-tamers can walk among them unharmed. To give them a taste for
human blood, criminals are sentenced to be dropped into the bear-pits,
and the ensuing carnage draws large crowds.
In times of war, to demonstrate that Ursun protects Kislev, the priests
drive the bears to the battlefield, and set them loose against the enemy
ranks, where they cause mayhem. Bears that die in the service of Kislev
are given solemn military funerals.
Sometimes high-ranking Boyars commission bear tamers to train bears
as battle-mounts, the ultimate symbol of power. These tamers are
among the most well-paid and well-respected.
Adventure Seeds
Bear Hunt: A bear tamer is embarking on an expedition to trap a cub,

Black Guard
You may not pass. Unless it is through Morr’s Gates you wish to travel.
(NDM) Whilst the cult of Morr has few, if any, official templars, they do have the Black Guard.
These universally dour and serious warriors have an even more serious responsibility: to guard
both the living and the dead from the endless malice of the Undead and those who would raise
them. For the most part, they are a defensive order, protecting the great temples and graveyards of
the Empire and the dignitaries of the cult, only riding to war in exceptional circumstances, such as
during a crusade against the Vampire counts. Unlike most knights, they are trained in the use of
ranged weapons to prevent their enemies from bringing their strength to bear in close quarters.
This, along with their foreboding black obsidian armour and their strict vow of silence when
on duty, means they are shunned by most other knightly orders, but such is the price of duty.

The Life of a Black Guard
Black Guards appear to watch the open portals of Morr’s temples
night and day, without rest. In truth, guard posts are split into three
shifts. However, each Black Guard is barely distinguishable from his
replacement, and guard changes are conducted so discreetly that even
someone standing nearby could miss it. When not on duty, Black
Guards conduct martial training exercises and attend lessons under
priests of Morr, who instruct them on theology and the undead.
When Morrian priests are required to travel long distances for funeral
services, a Black Guard often accompanies them. Black Guards have also
been known to escort priests of other gods, particularly Myrmidia and
Verena, when they visit a Morrian abbey. The Order sometimes assigns
Black Guards as chaperones under the false pretence of escort duty.
In towns where the Order of Morr houses the Fellowship of the Shroud,
Black Guards are prone to being caught up in cult politics. Although a
Black Guard’s responsibility is to the priests, many Black Guards aspire
to join the Knights of the Raven. They often assist the order’s Shroud
agents, hoping to make a favourable impression. If the assistance
involves destroying undead, Black Guards who abandon their posts can
later claim that they were simply obeying the strictures of Morr.
Black Guards are otherwise incorruptible. Only the most dedicated
of Morr’s followers could endure standing all day in full plate armour,
silent and expressionless. Only with express permission of the Order do
Black Guards leave their temples for long periods, typically for family
duties or religious pilgrimages.
Vows and Strictures
Black Guards observe all the regular strictures of Morr (see WFRP, page
176). In addition, they observe the following vows:
Vow of Stoicism: The service of Morr is to be taken seriously. Black
Guards may not laugh or make jokes, whether on duty or not. Their
stoicism is sometimes unintentionally humourous, but this does not
constitute a breach of their vow.
Vow of Silence: Black Guards may not participate in conversations
while on duty. If asked questions by superiors of the Order, Black
Guards may answer, but only with the minimal number of words. The
vow of silence does not apply to combat situations, when Black Guards
communicate in Battle Tongue.
Vow of Sacrifice: When faced with undead attackers, Black Guards
must defend Morr’s temples to the last drop of blood. Against living
opponents, or when facing the undead on neutral ground, Black Guards
are permitted to conduct a strategic retreat if the situation warrants.
Adventure Seeds
Gathering Evidence: The Fellowship of the Shroud suspects a respected
physician of practicing necromancy. One of the Shroud agents is a
junior priest of Morr, who wants to ban the physician from the temple.
The senior priest opposes him on lack of evidence, so the Shroud agent
privately appeals for the Black Guard’s help to find evidence.
Grave Robbers: The graveyard of a neighbouring village has been
despoiled by grave robbers. The Black Guard is given leave from temple
duties to inspect the crime scene and bring the culprits to justice if
possible.

Boatman
Are you looking for a ride up the river, sir? We – my captain and me, that is – can help you out with that -- for a
small fee, of course.
(Core) The rivers of the Empire are vital arteries of communication and commerce. They provide speedy
transportation and link most of the major cities of the realm. Boatmen ply these busy waterways, taking
passengers and goods throughout the Empire and even into Kislev. Although the rivers are safer than
the dark forest roads, they are not without danger. Many routes pass through wild country untouched
by civilisation. Boatmen must be ready to protect their cargoes and fares from raiders and bandits.
Experienced Boatmen are tough and resourceful, equally adept at boat handling, navigation, and
combat.

A Day in the Life
Boatmen typically spend long days steering their boats downstream or
rowing them upriver against the current. At journey’s end, the faster the
cargo is unloaded, the quicker a boatman gets paid and the sooner he
can toddle off to the nearest tavern while the captain arranges cargo and
passengers for the return trip.
Any downtime on board is spent mending, repairing and maintaining
the vessel and equipment. The work is backbreaking and tedious,
with occasional, long periods of boredom for good measure. Boatmen
rarely spend much time in one place, so it’s an ideal avocation both for
passable mutants and for serial criminals.
Boatmen act not only as crew to load, unload and handle the river craft
en route, but also as guardians against the many threats that seek to prey
on river traffic. River pirates are not unknown, and the occasional clever
bandits will create traps or logjams along the rivers to hinder or halt
traffic altogether, making them easy pickings for resourceful thieves.
A successful boatman must proficient in weaponry as well as the art of
ship handling. Some skill in carpentry is useful as well, for submerged
rocks and hidden snags can often damage a river craft; timely repairs can
prevent the loss of not only the vessel and cargo, but the crew as well.
Affiliations
The career of a Boatman tends to be an unfulfilling one. Boatmen who
are smart will save their money to either buy their own boat or buy a
piece of land and take to farming. Many boatmen become pirates or
smugglers, as the pay is better and the hours much shorter.
Still, boatmen tend to know members of the Dockers Guild --
responsible for loading and unloading ships in the larger cities – as well
as both merchant and military sailors. Connections such as these can
help provide career exit paths as well as information and the occasional
assist in not-strictly-legal acts.
It’s not unknown for a boatman particularly shrewd in handling money
to become a smuggler or merchant as soon as he has a few coins to rub
together, and with the connections on the docks and knowing which
palms to grease, such savvy individuals might make a nice living for
themselves.
Adventure Seeds
Dangerous Transport: The party is recruited for a mission to rescue
hostages captured by pirates or bandits upriver. The boatmen charged
with getting the party close to their quarry could be helpful, or they
may be in league with the kidnappers.
Smuggling Smugglers: The party is recruited to steal something from
a docked ship. The cargo is small and light, but valuable and sure to
be guarded. The players must rely on boatmen to get them close to the
ship without being seen, then get them away from the ship and into the
safety of a nearby marsh or the mouth of a river to avoid capture by the
authorities and the owners of the stolen goods. When the party hands
over the cargo, they may find they their payment is more than they
bargained for.

The House of Haessler
Perhaps the most famous bodyguards in the Empire are the black and
grey-clad House of Haessler. Colonel Reinhald Haessler of Altdorf
started this company after mustering out of the Imperial army. Badly
disfigured and sporting a hook in place of his left hand, Herr Haessler
decided that regardless of injury, retirement was not for him.
He recruited thugs and mercenaries, dangerous men who knew their
way around a fight, and otherwise might have turned to knee-breaking
or banditry. He equipped them and taught them military discipline.
His contacts within the army attracted his first clients and word of
mouth and his ruthless efficiency did the rest.
The House of Haessler has been in existence now for almost two
decades and has known nothing but success. Colonel Haessler has
built himself a private army and companies of the House are found
in almost every major city of the Empire. Key to his success is his ‘no
questions’ policy.
If a recruit obeys his rules and perform well in front of clients, the
Colonel doesn’t care where they come from. It is this very policy that
has created controversy and suspicion. Some claim that some of the
Empire’s most wanted criminals are among the ranks of the House
of Haessler, who have been given a reprieve from justice with the
Colonel’s help.
Luther Gorgen
Luther is a mountain of a man and among the most famous
independent bodyguards in the Empire. His reputation began when
he stopped an assassination attempt against a noble and his niece.
An assassin struck at the family, feathering Gorgen and three other
bodyguards, with poisoned darts. The other bodyguards died instantly,
victims of the assassin’s poison. Luther not only survived, he went on
to tackle the assassin and quickly subdued him while the noble’s family
escaped to safety.
An imposing figure at almost seven feet tall, some mutter that Luther
Gorgen must have ogre blood somewhere in his family line. Entirely
mercenary, Luther will work for anyone who can afford his salary, which
is extremely costly. But which former clients swear is well justified.
What his employers often don’t know is that the silent and stoic Luther
has leveraged his reputation to become a very successful information
broker. The quiet Luther hears much whispered by his employers in
their rarefied halls of power.

fiancée. The noble has promised a bonus for any particularly impressive
items that will dazzle his beloved.

(ToC) The Bondsman is a warrior in service to a particular Jarl. He is expected to
live in the Jarl’s Hall, share the Jarl’s food, and be steadfastly loyal. In exchange
for his pledge of loyalty, the Jarl rewards service with gifts, such as weapons
and armour, and to the very best, land and title. The worth of the gift is
never measured in actual value, but rather the prestige it bestows on
the Bondsman. It’s important to remember such gifts do not make the

Affiliations
Two relationships are of significant importance to bondsmen: their
loyalty to their jarl, and their relationship with their jarl’s other
bondsmen.
Loyalty is everything to a bondsman, because it is only through
his loyalty that he can advance. Jarls value insight, endurance and,
especially, martial prowess, but consider loyalty more important than
any of them. A bondsman with little talent beyond loyalty can advance
to die a freeholder, while a superb warrior whose loyalty is suspect
will find only an early death. A bondsman who betrays or fails his jarl
risks losing everything, so bondsmen obey their jarl’s orders without
question.
Relationships between bondsmen in the same clan are far more
complex. On the one hand, they must rely on each other during times
of war, and all are loyal to the their jarl, making them natural allies.
On the other, they are in competition for the jarl’s favour; a jarl has a
limited number of gifts to distribute between his bondsmen.
The Norse are a quarrelsome breed, but a jarl keeps order by punishing
infighting between his bondsmen with death. If a bondsman wants to
advance at the expense of a rival, he must be subtle. A jarl may reward a
bondsman who exposes disloyalty in another. There are always casualties
in battle, and sometimes a bondsman might engineer an “accident”
to befall a rival. However, anyone caught doing so may face a life of
slavery or a swift death.
Bondsmen are interested in their jarl’s success, because it directly
increases their prosperity. This self-interest reinforces the oath of loyalty,
and has made the system very resilient.
Little Known Facts
In some remote holds, where there is little wealth, few resources or
no tactical defences, there may not even be a true jarl. Instead, the
bondsmen swear loyalty to each other, and the fruits of plunder are
distributed by the vote of all the warriors. The warriors must be devoted
to a single ruinous power or to none, as mixed loyalties would soon tear
the group apart.
Bondsmen swear loyalty to their jarl over a weapon, called an oath
weapon, and traditionally use that weapon in their jarl’s service.
However, tradition holds that anyone who loses their oath weapon will
be cursed with ill fortune. When a bondsman is not wielding his oath
weapon in anger, he keeps it close, even taking it to bed with him at
night.
Adventure Seeds
A New Life: A bondsman is instructed by his jarl to travel south,
to the soft Empire, and gather information about possible targets for
raiding. When he returns, he will lead the raiders, and the jarl promises
land if he succeeds. Once the bondsman reaches the Empire, he has
second thoughts, and wishes to leave the employ of his jarl and start a
new life in the Empire. Can he be trusted, or is this all a ruse to learn
valuable information he will take back to his jarl?
Ruinous Rivals: A bondsman suspects that one of his fellow
bondsmen has made a secret pact with one of the Ruinous Powers.
Before he informs the jarl, he needs to catch his rival in some nefarious
act, and asks the characters to uncover – or contrive – whatever evidence
is necessary to implicate his rival.

Bonepicker
There’s a lovely bit of rubbish over here...
(Core) Bone Pickers are scavengers, scraping a living together off the refuse of
others. They lead their carts through villages and towns, collecting old bones, rags,
and other junk and disposing of it in return for a few pennies or a small item in
trade. Sometimes known as rag and bone men or rag pickers, they are a common
sight in the Empire’s cities, which generate large amounts of waste. Since many
goods pass through their hands, Bone Pickers are also petty traders. What is trash to a
wealthy Burgher is treasure to a poor Peasant.

Little Known Facts
Bonepickers are an excellent source of news and rumours. Going
through people’s trash daily as they do, they often have surprisingly
thorough knowledge regarding the goings on of people in their
community. Bonepickers can often be found waiting nearby for the
result of a battle, as such conflicts hold relatively fine pickings, and the
dead certainly have no need of their finery any longer.
There’s always a market for used weapons and armour, and what’s a little
bloodstain if the price is right? There is a short window of opportunity
for such gain, however, as the local constabulary or the surviving troops
drive them away from such finds with vicious efficiency.
A bonepicker’s life is filled with long toil for little gain, and rag and
bone men – as they sometimes call themselves – typically scratch a
living (as well as more than a few meals – bonepickers cannot afford the
luxury of discerning tastes) from other people’s trash.
Clever bonepickers know to offer the occasional small bribe to members
of the City Watch, as they can often provide information as to the
location of tasty pickings. For these reasons most citizens of the Old
World view bonepickers with no small amount of suspicion. They are
considered to be no better than vultures, feasting off the dead and the
refuse of their betters with equal relish. In the social hierarchy, there are
very few people a bonepicker can look down upon.
Affiliations
Savvy bonepickers will develop relationships with anyone and everyone,
and will keep a mental list of things to look for that someone wants.
Bonepickers tend to carry their finds with them wherever they go,
in large sacks or leather satchels strapped about their person; a truly
successful bonepicker will own a cart and some unfortunate animal to
pull it along, such as a donkey or a goat.
Extremely fortunate bonepickers may become modest merchants of
the lowest class. Eventually, through patience, hard work, and a great
deal of luck, they may even be able to build the sort of relationships
necessary to leave behind the life of a bonepicker and move into a more
traditional – and cleaner – line of work.
In fact, several successful merchants started out as bonepickers, though
having grown used to the comforts their new lifestyles allow them, few
would ever admit it.
Adventure Seeds
The Scroungers Will Know: The party is hired to help find a missing
item – a piece of jewellery or some such trinket has gone missing. Theft
is not immediately suspected, so the party turns first to bonepickers to
see if they’ve found the item in the trash or in the streets. Perhaps they
have and the item can be bought back from them. Perhaps they also
have information that their new employer is not entirely what he or she
seems to be.
Dark Discovery: A bonepicker approaches the party, hoping to hire
them as bodyguards. It would seem that this particular bonepicker
found something of unusual interest amongst the daily pickings, and
that something could cause a great deal of trouble for an important
person. Perhaps it’s a hint of a dark past, or it may even amount to
evidence of membership in a Chaos cult.

Border Courtier
Life in the borderlands is indeed rough. Good thing I’m here to look out for your interests.
(RC) Life in the courts of the Border Princes tends to be a bit more literal than in more civilised
lands. Smearing an opponent involves physical mud, backstabbing involves a knife, and the losers in
political contests really are gutted. Courtiers in the area thus tend to be a bit more physical than those
in other regions.
The Border Courtier haunts the home of a Border Prince, hoping to survive long enough to take that
position himself. Scheming, murder, and betrayal are his normal modes of operation. Paranoia is an
occupational hazard, and hypocrisy is a qualification for the job.

Imaschiavelli Venedetto
Over the course of his thirty year imprisonment in the Border
Principality of Matorea, the Tilean philosopher, Imaschiavelli Venedetto
penned his infamous treatise “The Border Prince.” Venedetto’s
manuscript functions as a kind of guidebook for young border
courtiers to the proper application of power (and guile) over a Border
Principality. Venedetto concisely laid out the steps for seizing a Border
Principality, and then how a prince should go about maintaining that
power once it is seized.
Unlike the many existing treatises on statecraft, Venedetto rejected the
Imperial inclination to decide patronage and succession through the
bartering of influence and flattery. Smooth talk and deep pockets might
well succeed in the perfumed courts of the Empire, but the acquisition
of land and title in the volatile Border Kingdoms would require sterner
methods.
Assassination, treachery and any kind of scheme to damage the
reputation of one’s competitors were all permissible and indeed
recommended if they advanced the border courtier’s agenda. Venedetto
went on to write that the primary concern of every border courtier
should be the preparation for war—war against his competitors, and
war against those in his way. Even though an aggressive courtier is likely
to gain many enemies on his ruthless ascent, Venedetto argued that it is
better to be feared than loved…
The first printing of “The Border Prince” was an immediate sell-out in
Remas, where the merchant and patrician classes have always shared an
insatiable appetite for any salacious material concerning their spirited
eastern neighbours. Before long, subsequent printings of “The Border
Prince” were translated and distributed throughout the Old World.
Predictably, the ideas contained within Vendetto’s manual were shocking
to the cultivated Imperial reader, and “The Border Prince” was quickly
banned across the Empire.
The List
Whether it is kept as names on parchment, or notches on a dagger
hilt, every border courtier has his own version of “the list”. The list is
an inventory of the future victims who stand between the courtier and
the position he covets. As new competitors emerge and old enemies
are wiped away, the list expands and narrows until there is but one
name standing between the courtier and his goal. Of course, the larger
and more established Border Principalities tend to have longer lines of
succession and more pretenders to the throne to deal with.
As a result of this deadly gamesmanship, one of the favoured pastimes
throughout the Border Kingdoms is to make wagers on the survivability
of an ascending prince’s projected targets. Bettors can increase their
payout significantly by correctly predicting the method of assassination,
as well as the order of victim removal. Death by poisoning generally
pays even money since anyone can taint a bowl of soup. The highest
payouts are reserved for the more baroque methods of execution, such
as death by the hand of a family member. Nothing pleases the crowd
more than to count the heads rolling as a newly emerging Border Prince
carves a bloody path to the throne.
Adventure Seeds
The Prince Borders: Two warring princes divide control over a town

Bounty Hunter
I’m bringing you back. Live, dead. Don’t matter to me. Worth more live, but you seem to be the sort that won’t
come quietly. Dead it is, then.
(Core) Bounty Hunters live by tracking down wanted criminals, bandits, and fugitives and bringing them to
justice. The lone Bounty Hunter can go places that ungainly military units cannot, which makes such men
a useful adjunct to the watch and militia. Local rulers, guilds, and councils pay the bounties. They may find
Bounty Hunters distasteful, but they are an effective counter to brigands, Goblin bands, and the like.
Bounty Hunters are professional killers who place little value on sanctity of life. They are utterly
ruthless, using their formidable skills to track and eliminate their quarries. The poor view them with
fear, since more than one Peasant has been murdered and passed off as the real culprit. The authorities
view them as a necessary evil, but never a welcome one.

Affiliations
While the watch, Imperial army, and the like tend to look down on
bounty hunters, they are wise enough to see their uses and maintain ties
with them. In fact many bounty hunters were once watchmen or militia
members before circumstance or the promise of gold lured them away.
Successful bounty hunters use these ties to get their job done and a wise
hunter keeps on good terms with the local watch. Within their own
ranks, however, bounty hunters are usually far less cordial. After all,
another hunter is someone who is after your bounty.
However, over the years and probably as a result of some unpleasant
encounters between bounty hunters, an unwritten code has arisen.
Known as “the bounty hunter’s code” or just “the code,” it prohibits a
hunter from taking another’s bounty once that bounty is caught. Of
course, most hunters will say it is really just a set of guidelines...
On the rare occasions when a large or particularly dangerous bounty is
on offer, hunters will team up to get the job done. These bounty hunter
gangs are known as “hounds,” and have a reputation for brutal efficiency
in the pursuit of their quarry. A hound, however, is usually an uneasy
alliance between dangerous men, and lasts only until they complete
their task. Then, all bets are off.
Notable Figures
Bounty hunters have always had a reputation as a dangerous breed
among the citizens of the Empire, and a rightly deserved one at that.
However, even within the ranks of their nefarious profession, few can
live up to the legend of the man known as Siegfried Schols.
Though not much to look at, this small and dishevelled old man is a
ruthless and dogged adversary who will tirelessly pursue his prey to the
end of the Old World and beyond.
In one famous case Schols tracked the infamous murder known as the
Nightmare of Nordland across four provinces for more than a year,
before finally catching him in a Carroburg gambling den.
It is rumoured that he hid for three day in the den’s privy, knowing that
his prey would eventually arrive, before leaping out and slapping him
in manacles. Regardless of the rumour’s truth, more than one wanted
criminal keeps a keen lookout while visiting the privy.
Adventure Seeds
Too Good to Pass Up: It seems that the niece of the Earl of
Sunderburg has been murdered, and the uncle is offering 200 gold
crowns and a promise of land to the man that can bring the culprit to
justice. Such a high bounty has attracted scores of interested parties,
some of questionable motives, to Sunderburg. As more and more
would-be bounty hunters arrive, the Earl is beginning to doubt the
wisdom of his offer.
No Greater Prey: Word has come from the town of Gerzen in the
province of Hochland that a bounty hunter by the name of Deitmarr
Haus has been accused of a heinous crime and has fled into the Tangled
Hills. Catching him is a challenge many bounty hunters will leap at, as
they expect to find a worthy adversary in one of their own.

Burgher
Hmm? What did you need? Can’t you see I’m terribly busy right now? This town doesn’t run itself, you know.
(Core) As cities have become more and more important to the Empire, a new class of citizen has
emerged: the Burgher. Burghers – or their ancestors – clawed their way up from the peasantry
and made new lives for themselves in the cities. Now they are the glue that holds urban society
together. Burghers are shop owners, petty merchants, excisemen, traders, and local officials.
They are neither as despised as the peasantry nor as exalted as the nobility. While they suffer
the most from plague, living in tightly packed neighbourhoods as they do, they would not
leave the city for a life of hard toil in the country. In their minds, cities breed opportunity,
not just disease.

A Day in the Life
A burgher’s life begins with the dawn. No matter his job, he must wake
early to prepare for it. A shopkeeper will rouse apprentices, a clerk will
begin to warm his small office and sort through the paperwork from
yesterday, a state official will take a quick breakfast and begin his long
trek to work.
The day will usually pass as the day before, and the day after. The
burgher must constantly work to please others. There are impatient
customers, angry nobles demanding answers to their questions, and
irate merchants wondering when their forms will be completed. Daily
life is a constant game of inflicting indignities on those whom it is
safe to harass, while humbly accepting them from those who must be
heeded. On rare occasion, there are moments of unexpected pleasure – a
wealthy man is pleased with his work and promises to recommend the
burgher, or he has a chance to humiliate and crush a rival without fear
of retribution.
At the end of the day, the burgher counts his coin, and compares it to
his expenses. If there’s even a small bit left over, he can store it, in the
hopes he, or his children, may someday rise in station. On occasion,
he dreams of adventure, of great risks and great windfalls, of the
unexpected and the unplanned crashing in on his ordered, plodding life.
For some this is a dream; for others, a nightmare.
Affiliations
A man alone is a man brought down! No matter a burgher’s trade, he
does it with the aid and consent of some sort of guild or brotherhood.
The guild serves two functions – to protect its members from the
outside, and to police its members so as to avoid trouble. The guild will
set weights, measures, standards, and pay scales. It will regulate the total
number of professionals in a town, and certify any newcomers as fit to
practice their trade.
It will serve to provide support in times of crisis, a pension for widows,
and so on. It will also demand obedience. Guildmasters can end a man’s
career with a word, and a craftsman blackballed from a guild may never
work again.
Anyone who deals with him will face the wrath of all the guilds, not
just his own. Guilds veer between honest and corrupt, and the forces
of Chaos find them excellent targets. Control a few key men, and you
control all the professionals in a large city.

who earned a place with battlefield exploits are more respected because they have lived war, not just
read about it in books.

Cadet Training
Early each morning a bugle summons the cadets from their barracks for
a bout of vigorous exercise around the parade ground. They must then
don their uniform and rank up for inspection before they are allowed
breakfast. The rest of the morning is occupied by classes, where topics
such as the history of warfare, battle tactics and the theory of command
are studied, usually taught by officers retired due to injury. The head
tutor, known as the Commandent, is often a high-ranking officer, the
veteran of many battles.
Another formation drill precedes lunch, and the afternoon involves
more classes to sharpen the mind, followed by rigorous athletic activity
and weapon practice to strengthen the body. The cadets are inspected a
final time before supper, and evening is reserved for personal study, until
lights out at midnight. During important festivals, such as Year Blessing,
the evenings involve a formal meal in full dress uniform.
The cadets’ lives are strictly regulated, and discipline is severe, instilling in
them a healthy respect for order. Even on Festag, the week’s holiday, the
college’s priest of Sigmar or Myrmidia lectures the cadets on moral fibre.
A cadet spends three years at college. During the summer month of
Nachgeheim, cadets are attached to a regiment. If a cadet is lucky, the
regiment will be at war, but experiencing army life firsthand in peacetime
is also invaluable to his military education. Many officers find cadets a
nuisance and give them ridiculous orders to keep them out of the way, or
otherwise amuse themselves playing cruel pranks on them.
During their final year at college, cadets must study hard to pass their
exams. Those that make the grade are commissioned as an officer of
the Imperial army and leave the school to join a regiment, an occasion
marked with riotous celebrations.
Cadet Schools
One of the most renowned cadet schools in Reiksland is the Diesdorf
Military College, founded by Emperor Wilhelm III in 2440. The
Imperial treasury funds the school, so entry is not reserved for the
wealthy. The college attracts men already serving in the military whose
talents for leadership have not gone unnoticed. Entry requires only a
recommendation from a superior.
The yearly intake of 180 cadets is divided into companies of 60,
commanded by a major, each further divided into platoons of 20,
commanded by a captain. Platoons are named after a famous battle:
Black Fire Pass, Blood Gorge, Hel Fenn, Nebelheim, Swartzhafen,
Maustadt, Wolfenberg, Howling Hills and Grim Moor.
The college’s Commandent is Captain Theocritus von Hayek, an old
soldier retired from the army of Nordland after he lost his right arm to
a Norscan’s axe. He runs the place with the same fierce discipline with
which he commanded his troops, and expects his students to graduate as
the epitome of the officer class: loyal, selfless and bound by honour. His
school has certainly been successful in this regard; among its alumni are
many highly decorated Imperial officers.
Adventure Seeds
Missing in Action: A cadet from a wealthy noble family is missing,

A Day in the Life
Most people think camp followers are lazy, slovenly folk, who do
nothing but trail behind armies and scavenge from their debris and
the carnage after each battle. They’re only partially wrong. Most camp
followers are scavengers who survive by picking over campsites and
battlegrounds, and most care little for appearance or cleanliness, but
they are far from lazy.
Camp followers get up early each morning. Many camp followers earn
small coin by fetching and doing other errands for soldiers, particularly
minor officers. They move through the camp offering to mend clothes,
carry messages, trim hair, and perform other minor tasks. Female
camp followers may also offer companionship to lonely soldiers. More
attractive women hope to become the personal companion of an officer
(or two), who can keep them in better style.
Acquiring food is also a daily chore. Camp followers hoard any food
they can find, from fresh produce swiped from local farms to scraps
from the soldiers’ meals of the night before. They eat quickly, wasting
nothing, and then make sure their food supplies are secure before
continuing their day.
Camp followers spend the day moving around the camp and any
associated battlegrounds. They snatch anything of value that has been
dropped, check any corpses for usable items and money, perform any
needed tasks, and generally keep their eyes open, their backs ready, and
their mouths shut. They eat after the soldiers, since mealtimes are the
most common time for a soldier to send someone to fetch him more
food or fresh water, and don’t sleep until after the soldiers are all abed
and the camp has been scoured one last time.
Little Known Facts
There is a pecking order among camp followers. Newcomers are not
allowed to approach soldiers directly or to enter a battlefield. They have
to take orders from more experienced followers, and get paid a share of
any coin offered. Once the newcomer has proven himself, he is allowed
to move through the camp and speak to lesser soldiers, though a more
experienced follower keeps tabs on him. Only camp followers who have
proven themselves are allowed to scavenge the battlefields.
Included in the pecking order is a sense of solidarity. Though camp
followers compete to be assigned tasks, especially easy chores among the
officers, they know that working together makes life easier for everyone.
If a camp follower is too busy to take on an additional task, he will
suggest another follower for it. If a follower sees something to scavenge
and lacks the time or strength to get it, he will tell another about it.
Camp followers also protect each other. There is a certain amount of
leeway allowed for soldiers and even more for officers; camp followers
are used to occasional beatings, but excessive mistreatment will cause
retaliation from the entire follower community, and they can destroy an
army in a thousand little ways.

Cantor
I raise my voice in song to raise the spirits of our faithful and the energy of our god.
(ToS) Cantors are talented singers who have devoted themselves to performing in temple choirs and
during rituals. Cantors are responsible for leading choirs during services as well as for instructing
individual choristers. Some cantors are also skilled musicians and write new hymns in praise of their
Gods. As well as singing hymns, many cantors are skilled at performing incantations and rhythmic
chanting that aids priests in performing divine rituals, and for the most potent of rituals a high priest
may request the presence of many cantors. The common symbol of office for a cantor is a short staff
used to strike the ground (or out of tune choristers, if necessary) to keep tune with the music when
leading a choir. A skilful cantor can easily enhance the reputation of a temple and its priests.

As the four priests lowered the coffin into its tomb, the high priest
finished Morr’s Litany. Eckhardt raised his hands and as Accolo closed
his prayer book, soprano voices filled the air around them, followed by
the altos and basses with each their canons in turn.
The power our voices can summon, may it be put to grander purpose than
merely a noble’s requiem. May this hymn grant holy power to a Dream, not
just a Death.
Eckhardt let his own baritone voice join the chorus, his cantor’s staff
ringing off the grey marble to punctuate his hymn’s refrains. In honor of
the deceased and his dreams.

Our Lady’s Brightest Song: A famous cantor of Verena’s church was
expected days ago for a chorale, but she and half her choir have gone
missing on the road from Nuln. Coachmen found the male choristers, all
badly injured, but the women are missing. Local Verenan priests hire the
party to either recover or avenge “our Lady’s brightest song.”
In Memoria
Geheimnisnacht is upon us, glory be it to Morr, the Great Raven.
Eckhardt von Rach raised grey eyes to the night sky, thankful for the
full moons that graced the Night of Mystery. This, his first holy night
as cantor for the Shrouded Garden of Morr, would be the first time his
newest hymn, “Raven’s Ode,” would be performed.
May the Lord of Dreams and Portents accept this meager offering of words
and song to herald the coming of a great soul to his keeping as God of the
Dead. On this night, we bury Lord Varrakhen, and this ode is in his honor
and yours, milord.
His heavy chorister’s robes staved off the autumn chill, though his
thrown-back hood could not protect his tonsured head from it. Eckhardt
felt the breeze swirl about him as he stood on the last step of the dais,
looking up at the choir he’d assembled from the surrounding villages.
A motley bunch at best, and young, but their voices suit my needs. They need
not fully understand the glory of Morr – they need only carry a tune and let
it travel to him. My faith and my piety shall be enough for all of us.
The seven priests behind him entered Morr’s Litany, the final funerary
prayer intoned among the high priest and the six priests bearing the
coffin. The funeral attendants were properly silent, in respect for the dead
man in front of them and the ruler of the underworld around them, his
garden of tombs nestled within this forest clearing.
Eckhardt listened closely, remembering the long-ago studies that burned
the Walk of the Dead and its cadences into his head. He remembered its
path from services he performed, always treading exactly 116 steps from
the start of the litany to the dead man’s final rest.

Affiliations
Because of their elevated rank and military standing, captains tend
to associate with other officers and with city officials and burghers.
Captains tend to be paid well for their services, so persons of many
different occupations try to make themselves useful to a captain in the
hope of earning some of his coin.
A well-connected mercenary leader will keep himself informed of the
various commanders in the city; one never knows when one will need
to look for a new employer, and with the frequent incursions of Chaos,
orcs and less mentionable things, armies are almost always hiring. A
captain looking to get promoted would do well to cultivate friendships
with Artillerists, members of the various Knightly Orders, and even
priests and leaders of the many wholesome cults within the Old World.
 A word in the right ear at the right time can get a captain noticed by
his superiors and promoted to a better (and possibly safer) position.
Likewise, an ill word in the right ear at the wrong time can have a
captain assigned to the next expedition to the Chaos Wastes.
Notable Figure
Captains are sometimes assigned lands and granted a writ of nobility
after a particularly successful campaign or for performing remarkable
and noteworthy deeds.
A classic example of this is Otto Trondheim, a former captain of the
guard of the Elector of Stirland, who was raised to the rank of noble by
the Elector after single-handedly defeating eight black orcs in personal
combat, and leading his men in the rout of an invading army of the
greenskins.
 Sadly, when the entire population of the town he governed was killed
and raised as zombies by one of the Vampire Counts of nearby Sylvania,
he was forced to abandon his castle and flee; he was never seen or heard
from again.
Adventure Seeds
You’re in the Army Now: Captains frequently need trained soldiers
on short notice to bolster the ranks for an expected clash. At times
like these, it doesn’t pay to be too picky, and so the party is hired on
as support troops for the army. They will most likely be used as scouts
to find the enemy or, failing that, a promising campsite for the night.
Scouts, if they are not careful and not very good at what they do, can
find themselves surrounded by the enemy in a flash and taken prisoner,
killed, or worse.
Too Much of a Good Thing: The party must obtain a particular item
from a military storehouse run by a captain who is rumoured to be a
wee bit corrupt. If they present their case to him openly, the Captain
proves to be more than willing to give them the item, if, in exchange,
they will help him off-load some additional items that risk drawing too
much attention to his little operation.
Out of Retirement: Goblin raiders are ravaging nearby villages.
The local militia struggles to keep the roads safe and refugee peasants
stretch the town’s resources to its limits. A retired army captain lives a
quiet, hermetic life on the outskirts of the area, and the town leaders
are desperate to put his military know-how to use, helping train and
organise the milita.

Carcassonne Shepherd
Shush, my little lambs. No man nor beast shall bother you while I’m here.
(KotG) The shepherds of Carcassonne are the dukedom’s first line of defence against the Orc raiders
who infest the mountains. They often work alone, though a new recruit may be paired with an older
individual. Obviously, a single Human, no matter how well trained, cannot expect to take on an entire
Orc war-band, so the Shepherds are trained to gather information, slow the band down, and report its
location to the local nobility.
They also look after flocks of sheep. A shepherd who loses his sheep is mercilessly mocked by
his fellows, which leads many of them to take absurd risks to recover even a single
lost lamb.
Male and female characters may freely enter this career. Bretonnian nobles
would have to conceal their noble background to do so, but that does
happen.

A Day in the Life
A shepherd’s life on the high plains of Carcassonne is a life of duty,
sacrifice, and isolation. As Bretonnia’s first line of defence against the
greenskins to the south, it falls upon the Carcassonne shepherd to patrol
the lonely northern foothills of the Iranna Mountain range and the
vulnerable pastures beyond.
The shepherd’s day begins at the crack of dawn, or earlier if the moons
were particularly bright and the flock was restless. Once the shepherd
has gathered his flock, it’s time to move on to greener pastures—
literally. The shepherd’s primary responsibility is to move his sheep from
one grazing ground to the next in a constant progression towards fresh
grasses. Because it takes time for grazing land to replenish, and certain
areas are lusher in different seasons, most shepherds develop their own
grazing routes over the years, which they follow habitually.
Before darkness falls, the shepherd and flock must locate their bedding
ground for the night. This is a place with some kind of natural
protection from the elements, such as a box ravine, a stand of trees or
even the lee of a rock bluff. Most shepherds have their favourite bedding
grounds dotted around his grazing route. Some areas have communal
bedding grounds which can accommodate multiple shepherds and their
flocks.
The shepherd community is small, but closely knit. When a group of
shepherds converge at a bedding ground, it’s not long before someone
brings out a jug of wine and the campfire tales begin. A shepherd can
travel for days in the desolate foothills without seeing another soul,
so an evening spent among colleagues is a cherished occasion. These
spontaneous meetings can also be an important opportunity for the
shepherd to exchange news and reports of enemy movement.
The Bretonnian Blue Sheepdog
Often, a shepherd’s only companion throughout his long patrols in the
high country is his trusty sheepdog. The Bretonnian Blue Sheepdog
has a long history of use among the shepherds of Carcassonne. No one
knows for sure where the animals originated, although local legend has
it that the intelligent creatures house the reborn spirits of dead fay.
The Bretonnian Blue plays an integral role in the shepherd’s day to
day control of his flock, as well as a vital security function. Bretonnian
Blues have extremely keen hearing and eyesight, making it almost
impossible for an enemy to approach undetected. Many older shepherds
also believe that Blues can detect ghosts, but this is unsubstantiated.
Bretonnian Blues are extremely loyal to their masters, and will defend
them to the death.
Bretonnian Blue Sheepdogs use the statistics given for Dogs (see WFRP
page 232), with the addition of Acute Hearing and Excellent Vision.
Adventure Seeds
A Wayward Flock: The intermittent sound of war-drums can be heard
echoing from the mountains above. When a flock of untended sheep is
discovered, the shepherds of Carcassone call in all favours to locate their
missing comrade.
Buying Time: On the heels of a massive blizzard, a large host of
greenskins has been sighted in a nearby mountain pass. The aftermath
of the storm will prevent the lords of Carcassonne from responding
before the orcs have long since razed the countryside. That is if the
stupid greenskins don’t cause an avalanche first… The task of delaying
the horde to allow the muster of reinforcements falls to the shepherds,
and they will be glad to receive any help they can get.

Cartographer
Hmm... What an interesting anomoly. The details of the coastline suggest an inlet along

(New) Cartographers chart the lay of the land for rich patrons, hardy explorers,
and collectors. They accompany expeditions into the wild but also transpose
the shoddy work of others into a more readable form. Maps in the Old World
are notoriously unreliable – whether they are surveys of local trails, ambitious
region wide guides, or the mainly fictional representations of the Old World
itself. Yet the services of Cartographers are still in great demand.

Lost
The man bundled down the dune, kicking up sand in an effort to
re-find his footing, but failing. He rolled again and again, his pack
coming loose and spilling its contents onto the burning sand. Finally
he came to rest at the foot of the dune and settled in a heap. After a few
moments, he stirred.
The traveller’s lips were thin and his features gaunt from lack of water.
His face was burned red and blistered from the sun. He did not
remember losing his wide-brimmed hat; it must have gone some time
earlier that day. He reached for his water skin and held it to his lips.
Only a few meagre drops found its way into his parched mouth.
In the glaring light, the man scrambled back up the yielding sand,
towards his pack. Digging around he found what he was looking for.
He unrolled the large scroll of parchment and inspected it. He did not
understand. His navigation should have been flawless. It was clearly
marked on his map, the river valley that led across the great desert, with
its oases and glades, its villages and roads, and its elephants. They were
all clearly marked, but he had found no sign of them.
The man noted the map-makers name in a legend at the corner of the
map; Kurt Brombeer, Bergsburg, Hochland, it stated. If that was as
accurate as the rest of the map, then it was hardly likely this man even
existed, but still he cursed that name with his dying breath.
Here be Dragons
Alois Krause’s motto is ‘Give them what they want.’ If they are looking
for treasure, he can come up with a treasure map; if they want a short
cut through the mountains, he will deliver. He is a talented cartogrpaher
with an artistic flourish, but he has never been known to let the truth
get in the way of a good map. Surprisingly, he finds that the more
outlandish his maps, the more fanciful the details, the more willing
some gullible fool will be to pay for it.
And so he makes his living doing what he enjoys without having to go
to the trouble of tedious groundwork like research or surveying. But he
is modest, too. He never takes the credit for his works of art, preferring
to sign them on behalf of more credible and reputed cartographers from
around the Empire and beyond.

Clerical Errors: The local noble calls on a well known cartographer
for an audience. He is certain that the official maps in the provincial
land registry are inaccurate. Because of this, several villages that should
belong to his estate are in fact paying their dues to a rival baron.
The noble needs a cartographer to travel into that barony and map
it accurately from top to bottom. The only catch: the baron already
suspects this may be happening, and has agents everywhere. And so the
cartographer must do the entire project without anyone at all getting
wind of it.

Then he wants three identical copies of the map made. He witnesses the
criminals, in the middle of nowhere, burying a heavy chest. It becomes
obvious to him that once he has finished his maps, the mob will do him

Cat Burglar
The secret to getting in is choosing the right window. The secret to getting out is choosing the right door.
(Core) Cat Burglars see themselves as a cut above the common thieves and footpads. They leave
the slitting of both purses and throats to the gutter scum, preferring to steal with more
finesse. The Cat Burglar’s art requires observation, planning, and impeccable timing. A
well-executed theft may not even be detected for months, by which time the Cat Burglar
is far away. Most Cat Burglars are members of a Thieves’ Guild, though some defy
the odds and go it alone. Such lone wolves must elude both the law and the guild; a
dangerous game to be sure.

Little Known Facts
Cat burglars get their name from Ranald’s totemic animal, for their
methods epitomise the trickster god’s night prowler aspect. Cat burglars
usually pray at one of Ranald’s secret shrines before each mission, and
several unlucky burglars have been caught this way.
However, the cult of Ranald receives generous donations following
successful burglaries, so it takes a powerful enemy (or an irresistible
bounty) to make Ranald’s brethren betray a cat burglar. Retired cat
burglars often become lay priests of Ranald, serving their god in spirit
when the body is no longer able.
The close connection between the cult of Ranald and the thieves’ guilds
makes it dangerous for cat burglars to anger either group. Cat burglars
who dare to operate outside the Thieves’ Guild are usually specialists in
rare artwork, jewellery, or relics. Those few conventional cat burglars
who remain independent of a thieves’ guild – and manage to evade its
thugs – are highly favoured by Ranald.
Most priests of Ranald face a difficult choice at least once during their
careers: betray a maverick cat burglar who’s blessed by Ranald, or lose
favour with the thieves’ guild.
Tools of the Trade
A cat burglar relies on a variety of interesting tools and implements to
help him with his burglaries. Following are a few examples.
Climbing Claws: These small, metal claws are strapped to the hands,
providing a +5% bonus to Scale Sheer Surface Tests. (2 gc. very rare, 2
enc)
Glass Cutter: When lockpicks fail, this wheel-shaped blade can be used
to enter through windows. An average window requires 10 minutes to
score and remove. On a successful Ag Test, the window is removed with
only moderate noise. PCs with the Trade (Glass Blower) skill succeed
automatically. Multi-faceted windows require a small hacksaw to cut
through the joints. (8 gc, very rare, 2 enc)
Harpoon Grapple: This modified crossbow fires a grappling hook
distances that a thrown hook can’t reach. The hook is fitted with a
barbed tip for anchoring into wood. (35 gc, very rare, 150 enc)
Padded Shoes: These shoes offer poor traction, but improve Silent Move
tests by +5%. If a quick exit becomes necessary, padded shoes can be
discarded using a Half Action. (1 gc, rare, 6 enc)
Adventure Seeds
Territory Rights: When a young cat burglar arrives in town, he’s
challenged to a “duel” by the local veteran. His rules are simple: the
thief with the most marks after one night’s work wins. The loser leaves
town. Marks are scored by leaving a “calling card” at the crime scenes
and having the burglaries reported on the town’s news bulletin.
A Very Big Score: An initiate of Ranald tells the cat burglar about a
priceless gemstone. In truth, the initiate is a Chaos spy, planted to help
his cult leader obtain a power stone. After stealing the gem, the cat
burglar finds himself hunted by Chaos cultists, the gem’s owner, and
possibly the thieves’ guild.

Catechist
Initiate Borgas, if you’re so eager to talk during lessons, perhaps you’d care to stand and recite
the Seventeen Virtues of Shallya to the rest of the class?
(ToS) The Catechist is a religious teacher versed in the study of holy scripture and stricture who
teaches the finer points of both to any who wish to listen (or are forced to listen). They are rarely
as open-minded or clever as scholars, favouring tradition over progress and learning by rote over true
understanding. A Catechist is usually responsible for the religious education of a temple’s initiates, even
if they themselves are merely lay members. Not all Catechists are religious in nature – some concentrate on
studying the arcane but lack the talents to become a wizard, instead teaching theory to apprentices at one of
the Colleges of Magic.

A Day in the Life
Catechists are lay brothers, members of a religious order but not
ordained priests, and most take their religious devotions very seriously.
Because of this, their days are divided into religious observances and
classes.
Most catechists rise at dawn, wash quickly, and dress for morning
prayers. After this they break their fasts with the other priests and lay
priests. Then they teach their first class.
This is usually the most introductory of their lessons, aimed at new
acolytes and novices and providing a general overview of the god and
his or her demands on worshippers. This is the class most likely to be
attended by worshippers who do not intend a career in the priesthood,
but simply wish to learn more about their god.
After the first lesson come a simple lunch and a short afternoon prayer
before the afternoon lessons. These tend to be general education,
reading, writing, and basic numbers. A catechist might also teach
history, herbalism, and languages.
Next come the evening prayer and meal. After these, the catechist
teaches the more advanced classes, which are only open to priests. These
lessons focus on specific religious practices, dogma, and privileged
information about the god. After these final lessons is the nighttime
prayer before bed. Catechists, like priests, rarely stay up late, though
some read and prepare for lessons before snuffing their candle and lying
down.
Notable Figures
Hradgar Nalufson is a catechist and lay brother of the Church of Ulric.
A short, stout man with a round head and very little hair, Hradgar
appears almost ludicrous waddling about in his ceremonial furs and
armour. His comical appearance hides a first-rate mind, however. Those
who study under Hradgar come away not only extremely knowledgeable
in the ways of Ulric but also deeply impressed with the stocky catechist.
Because Hradgar serves at the temple in Middenheim, he has in fact
trained many of the major priests of Ulric, including the current High
Priest, and is often consulted on matters of importance. This makes
Hradgar extremely powerful, especially since he is only a lay brother and
thus not bound by as many strictures and oaths as his priestly brethren.
Adventure Seeds
A Special Student: The catechist is summoned by his temple’s head
priest and given an unusual assignment – he is told to educate a young
noble’s son in general skills and in the ways of their god. This provides
the catechist with access to a different world, but also requires him to
revise his teaching methods and perhaps his thinking as well.
Brother Against Brother: A priest has been murdered, and all signs
suggest a fellow priest could be responsible! No one knows why, but
since the victim had no enemies it may not have been personal. The
catechist and his brethren are asked to consider the matter and discover
any knowledge that could have gotten the priest killed. But if finding
that knowledge got the priest killed, what will it do to the catechist who
discovers it?

Cenobite
Suffering? Yes, it is the sweetest lesson that can be learned. And I have learned it well.
(RC) Cenobites live in communities, generally called monasteries, and follow
the advice of a leader. The leader is often charismatic but often equally insane.
At the very least, they are fanatical followers of a very personal vision of the truth
(the con-artists do not set up in the Borderlands). Most Cenobites are Human;
members of other races rarely show much interest, though most monasteries
would admit them if they asked. Unwanted children are sometimes left on the
doorsteps of monasteries. These children are taken in; those who do not run away
are accepted as Cenobites. Most run away.
Option: It is possible for those who seek to purify mind and body to volunteer to become
cenobites, even though most are raised in the role. With GM approval, the cenobite career may
be entered from apprentice wizard, initiate, grave robber, or zealot.

A Day in the Life
Born in pain. That is what it means to be a cenobite. While each
monastery differs, all share in common the belief that only through
purification of the flesh can the mind and the soul be liberated. Some
choose specific rituals and limitations – eating only the sparsest of food,
for example, or wearing clothes lined with thorns and briars which
constantly tear at the skin. The reward is purity of mind – freedom from
the temptations of Chaos.
Each day is one of routine, discipline, and study. Cenobites often go
among the townsfolk, asking for alms or propounding their particular
philosophy. Those who do not perform gruelling labour using primitive
tools at the monastery. Only the most enlightened receive instruction in
the higher mysteries, the secrets that the pain are meant to unlock.
The highlight of each day is the Evening Recital, where all members
of the monastery will pronounce some revelation or insight their day
of suffering has brought to them. This is where the oldest and wisest
cenobites will cull the truly worthy from the weak, determining who is
learning from their pain and who is merely being hurt.
A Cenobite Monastery
Every monastery has a different philosophy and a different focus. Some
claim to teach meditation techniques that grant complete immunity
to the powers of Chaos, others claim to unlock the completely safe
magical power hidden inside every Human being, and others claim
to impart ancient secrets of combat that go far beyond those known
today. Evidence suggests that all of the monasteries are wrong, and
the vast majority of Cenobites believe that the Cenobites at other
monasteries are deluded fools Almost all monasteries inflict great pain
and deprivation on their inhabitants, ostensibly as part of the path to
enlightenment. It could be argued that, as many Cenobites flee their
monasteries, this process actually works.
The buildings of a monastery tend to be simple, austere, and wellfortified.
They have a single gate, representing the single-mindedness
required to learn their secrets (and making it easy to defend), and at
least one tall tower, representing the heights to which they can lead a
person (and providing advance warning of any attacks). Beyond that,
they are suited to the location and available resources. The members of
a community are almost invariably of a single gender, though both male
and female monasteries are known.

The Search for Glory
In the long months of winter when armies must be barracked, or during
the rare times when the Empire’s borders enjoy peace, it is common
for the champion of a regiment to request leave to wander the lands
in search of opportunities to test his mettle. Each day spent enduring
the monotony of camp or meaningless drills is a day where his prowess
is wasted. The champion’s commander usually grants this request,
knowing that the champion will return to duty when needed. A wise
leader knows it is better for a champion to put his fighting abilities
to the test elsewhere than turn them against his fellow soldiers in
frustration.
A wandering champion will seize any chance to increase his renown,
whether it is dispatching a marauding goblin warband or slaying a
terrorising minotaur in its forest lair. Accruing money is secondary
to attaining glory, and a champion will often lend his sword-arm to a
worthy cause for no reward. For him, it is enough that his deeds will be
immortalised in story and song. The dream of the champion is to not
die old and rich, but fall with his bloodied sword in hand, dead enemies
at his feet, and his deeds crowned with honour.
Death Before Dishonour
The Storm of Chaos gave many ambitious champions the opportunity
to prove their worth. Among them was Dagmar Nachgeben, champion
of the Middenheim Greatswords, who held Middenheim’s southern
gatehouse alone against Archaon’s wild hordes after the rest of his
regiment was slaughtered defending it. He plugged the breach in the
gates with muscle and iron will, the honour of his regiment at stake.
Countless marauders and mutants fell before Nachgeben’s blade, and
he fought standing on a mound of their corpses. He claimed the heads
of three Champions of Chaos, though each towered above him, furious
with the wrath of their twisted gods. Finally, his vitality leaching from
a score of wounds, his face a mask of blood, he crossed his greatsword
with the fiery scimitar of the Chaos Lord Bellarus Deviltongue.
Deviltongue’s blood-hungry weapon clove through Nachgeben’s
blade and into his ribs, but summoning his last reserves of strength,
Nachgeben grappled his adversary. Together they toppled to their deaths
at the distant foot of the Ulricsberg.
Nachgeben halted the besiegers long enough for reinforcements to
secure the breach, his small victory one of the many that ultimately
saved Middenheim. A statue of Nachgeben has been erected at the scene
of his heroics. He fulfiled every champion’s ambition: His feats will
outlive him, commemorated in stone.

An Old Rival: A champion encounters an old competitor from his

champion has the opportunity to settle an old score, but doing so will
jeopardise his party’s mission.
An Unsavoury Master: A champion’s services are sought by a powerful

and status. However, once in his employment, the champion discovers
that his new master is a tyrant, and he is expected to enact his new
master’s oppressive cruelties against innocent folk. Will the champion

Charcoal Burner
Don’t mind the smoke, lad. You eventually get (hack, cough) used to it. (cough)
(Core) Charcoal Burners can be found in every village in the Empire. They burn wood to create
charcoal, an important fuel for the winter months. Since their work is both dirty and potentially
dangerous, they work outside their villages. The outskirts of the forest are best, as wood is easily
accessible. This proximity to the forest also makes charcoal-burning dangerous work, since
isolated parties of such men are easy prey for the malign creatures of the wood. A CharcoalBurner
camp always has weapons handy, even if they are nothing more than clubs cut from the
nearby trees.

A Day in the Life
Being a Charcoal Burner means days or even weeks living on the fringes
of civilisation and spending long hours tending to the great turf kilns
where they create their precious fuel. At the start of an expedition, a
Charcoal Burner rises early and treks into the woods, usually in the
company of a group of his fellows. Once they have reached their chosen
site, often picked for them by their employer, they begin felling trees.
This is long and hard work, and while some cut the wood, others
carefully watch the forest’s edge for signs of trouble.
Once enough wood is downed, the real work of the Charcoal Burner
begins. They pile the wood in a great mound and cover it with turf and
clods of earth, leaving holes around the base and at the top to let out
the smoke. Then the mound is lit and the burners settle in to wait and
tend the fires, a process that can take hours or sometimes days. After
this comes the dirty task of digging out the charcoal and hauling it back
to town, before heading back into the forest to do it all again.
The Secrets of Charcoal
While few citizens of the Empire would take the time to think about it,
charcoal is a vital ingredient fueling their nation’s industrial might and
domination of the Old World. A prized fuel for cooking and heating,
charcoal is far more valuable to weapon makers and gunsmiths. It keeps
their forges hot and makes their steel hard.
Nuln, in particular, is home to a legion of Charcoal Burners who work
tirelessly to fuel its furnaces. Evidence of their presence is apparent for
miles around the city – great plumes of smoke and acres of tree stumps.
Though he will suffer long hours of work for little pay, most charcoalburners
know there is always work in Nuln.
Many people do not realise there are many different types of charcoal.
These range from brown crumbling lumps to hard black rocks, and the
harder and darker the charcoal, the better it will burn.
The best kind of charcoal comes from the hard wood of deciduous trees
like the oak and elm, creating charcoal that burns hotter and longer.
Old oak trees are especially prized, and Charcoal Burners will sometimes
spend days searching a forest for such a tree, then days more cutting it
down and burning it. Such an effort is almost always worth the trouble ,
as the best weaponsmiths will pay handsomely for such fuel.

The Secret Ingredient: To forge a very special sword, the wizard-smith
Feldrek is looking for a very special charcoal made from the wood of
the Emperor Oak. The Emperor Oak is the rarest of trees, said only to
grow in the deepest parts of the Darkwald. Feldrek is looking for some
experienced folk to help him find it.
A Beast of a Problem: A group of Charcoal Burners are attacked by
beastmen on the edge of the Forest of Shadows near the town Gugen.
With only a handful of their number left they would abandon their
work, if only winter was not so close and the fuel so desperately needed.
With the beastmen sure to return, they need to find someone to watch
their backs until the fires have done their work.
Up in Smoke: A roadside temple to Taal was burned to the ground,
and the local priest of Taal suspects arson. Without the funds or clout
to request an official investigation, he secures the assistance of several
charcoal burners, well versed with fire and their results, to help uncover
what took place.

Charlatan
I’m out to steal every last moment’s peace out of my mark, not just his coin. Naught but doubts nor despair
shall fill the purses of my victims.
(Core) Charlatans are tricksters extraordinaire, cunning liars who can convince people of almost
anything. With their glib tongues and ready wits they bilk the gullible out of their fortunes and
escape with both the money and their lives. For a Charlatan, lying is like breathing. Common
Charlatans are content to sell worthless miracle cures and trinkets that will supposedly ward off
black magic whereas more skilled ones fake being other professions to collect consultation fees
and sell off property that they don’t own. Legendary Charlatans run con schemes that try to
take Nobles and rich Merchants for all they’re worth.

Thief of Hearts
“What’s the difference? Sir, you wound me, comparing me to a
common thief or burglar. It’s truly an insult, it is. It’s all about where the
focus lies. Thieves, burglars, and cutpurses only look for the pocket, the
jewel. I aim for the heart first and foremost. I want to steal someone’s
trust and love, not just their fence-able goods. I’ll steal dignity before
diamonds…but I won’t forget the diamonds. You want someone
embarrassed and impoverished, I’m the one to do it.”
Synnaela Maruvaal
The young elf Maruviel Naesyllna grew bored with life as an envoy
in Nuln, brokering trade deals among the witless and the greedy.
Excitement rarely entered her negotiation-laden world, until she
interrupted a dwarf thief at a noble’s manse as she sought refuge from an
overly amorous trade partner. Seizing the opportunity, Maruviel offered
an alliance with the thief in exchange for escape from the drudgery of
her life.
Since that night three years ago, the two women mutually conspire
to maintain their mutual thrills and profits. The dwarf became Karin
Dellardar while they traveled from Nuln to Marienburg, and they
established a false trading house through which both of them operate
scams. Maruviel adopted the role of Synnaela Maruvaal, a temptress
whose victims are too proud to admit they’d been swindled.
Synnaela’s richest mark was a Kislevite noble whom she fleeced of a
magical dagger of unmelting ice (and most of his jewelry) in exchange
for forged “letters of introduction” that led to exile rather than allowing
him an extended audience with Emperor Karl Franz.
Adventure Seeds
Jarla’s Escape: The local villages and surrounding forest is plagued by
a large number of thugs and ruffians. They hunt a woman named Jarla
Pelgrann, claiming the local lord demands her presence, and they inflict
a fair amount of damage to people and property. The party is in an inn
when an equal amount of thugs enter, pointing at a woman at a table
behind them, and charge. She smiles and tosses a small bottle on the
table in front of her. Smoke engulfs the taproom, “Jarla” escapes, and
thugs attack the party in the confusion!
A Bold Plan: Traveling to a remote settlement, the party poses as
rich merchants or foreign nobles seeking investors for their trade
consortium. They spur interest among the local nobility, resulting in
a celebration thrown in their honor and to discuss trade. How much
can the charlatans gull from the nobles and how far from them can the
party get before the lie is exposed?
Cloth of Gold: A textile merchant, new to town, is concerned about a
business deal he has recently become involved in. He sold his previous
business in Nuln to relocate to the area, on the promise that his textiles
would be in great demand in this region. However, the business partner
he dealt with has suddenly disappeared – along with several hundred
gold crowns worth of silks and satins.

Chekist
Does that hurt, comrade? I’m sorry; Sasha doesn’t know his own strength sometimes. Please
believe that I will learn what you’re hiding from me; when I do, our next meeting will not be
so pleasant.
(RotIQ) The principal goal of the chekist – the Ice Queen’s secret police – is to ensure the
personal and political security of the Tzarina and her family. This task is performed by any
means possible, regardless of local laws; after all, in Kislev, what the chekist deems as law, is
law. Their techniques employed to investigate the various Chaos cults, revolutionaries, criminals,
hostile organisations, spies, and manifold other “threats” are often brutal, leaving the chekist with
an ugly reputation. Their headquarters squat in Kislev city, but rumours suggest they have offices
throughout the Ancient Widow’s land, all siphoning information back to the capital. Some suggest
the chekist even have agents in the Empire and beyond, each monitoring the activities of foreign
threats to the Ice Queen and her rule; but this, of course, is denied.

Affiliations
Checkists have no official, structured organisations to speak of, save
in their devotion and duty to the Tzarina herself. They rule through
fear and intimidation – not qualities one seeks in a friend or drinking
companion.
Very few men can take the strain of such constant vigilance; many
chekist agents retire from the ranks after only a few years of active
service. The ruthlessness necessary to do their job doesn’t come naturally
for everyone, and only a few individuals truly have the utter lack of
compassion and unthinking dedication to their Queen that allows them
to forget the pain and suffering they inflict on individuals – some of
them innocent of any crime – for the good of the State.
Because of their connections to the chekist organisation, as well as the
many skills they honed while in the Tzarina’s service, retired chekists are
highly sought-after by all of the crowned heads of the Old World. For
the same reasons they are also prized by the criminal underworld, and
can command fat salaries if their reputation is fearsome enough.
Little Known Facts
Chekists are well known by reputation, but few claim to know anyone
actually belonging to the ranks of the Tzarina’s secret police force. In
the icy, wind-swept lands of Kislev, chekists are never spoken of openly,
especially in public.
Each chekist has a network of informers that they cultivate wherever
they go. These more frequently provide information for a little coin,
but some do so for the good of the homeland and the Queen. Chekist’s
informers provide regular reports, just as the chekists themselves must
account for their own actions ona daily or weekly basis if at home, or
weekly to monthly while in the field. Chekists have no desire to be
needlessly cruel, and those within their ranks who are will ultimately
find themselves suffering the same fate as those they tormented – at the
hands of the checkist.
Adventure Seeds
We’ve Got Company: The party, on an assignment in Kislev, is met
by a lone horseman all in black. The natives openly fear this man, and
his line of questioning of the party suggests he suspects them of being
spies. If they are not able to convince him of their innocence, he may
have them arrested, or he may follow them, hoping to catch them
committing crimes against the state of Kislev. He will follow the party
like a curse, appearing at the most inopportune times unless they can
demonstrate a lawful reason for entering the realm.
Did You See That?: While travelling within the Empire, the party
meets up with a merchant from Kislev. His warmth and gregarious
nature belie his true nature, though he is a competent merchant and
his wares – from his native land – are of top quality. However, a chance
encounter allows one or more of the party to witness him handing a
packet of papers off to a surly-looking Ungol, who mysteriously spirits
them away. The party may be witnessing the acts of a spy in their very
midst.
Watchful Eyes: A tradesman is growing increasingly distressed.
His business is under constant scrutiny by a particular chekist. The
tradesman’s business is legitimate, and he fears the unwanted attention
is due to the fact that the tradesman has fallen in love with a woman the
chekist himself fancies.

Chimneysweep
It’s not so bad when yer climbing up. It’s the getting stuck bit I don’t much like.
(FoN) In towns and cities throughout the Empire, households that can afford to do so burn
charcoal to ward off the chill of winter. Many industries also make extensive use of charcoal,
in particular the forges of Nuln. Heavy use clogs chimneys with soot, resulting in an increased
demand for chimney sweeps. A good many of these workers are children, but many are halflings
and particularly thin men. Working on the rooftops, they scrub out the chimneys to clear
blockages – usually soot, but sometimes, far stranger things.
Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute
Chimneysweep for Charcoal Burner with your GM’s permission.

A Sweep’s Life
Chimneysweeps, or sweeps as they call themselves, often work in pairs;
one feeding the brush into the chimney from the hearth, while his
partner shimmies up the chimney cleaning out soot deposits. Human
sweeps employ a child apprentice, normally taken from an orphanage
at the age of five. Halfling sweeps take it in turns to do the dirty work.
Their agility means they can do the job in a far shorter time than a
human child, and so are often preferred.
The work is gruelling, with countless hours spent wriggling in sooty
darkness. Sweeps often suffer from skin and breathing ailments, and
frequently burn themselves while climbing still-hot chimneys. Child
apprentices suffer the worst. Their masters takes the lion’s share of
the earnings, paying the apprentice with a few scraps of food, small
compensation for the risks they face. When an apprentice gets too big
to climb up inside the chimneys, he is quickly replaced by a younger
boy and left to fend for himself.
Most sweeps travel from town to town looking for work, especially in
the summer months, when work may be meagre and a master may force
his apprentice to go begging. Some unscrupulous masters encourage
their apprentices to sneak into rooms through the fireplace and pilfer
objects from the homes they service. If the boy is caught, the master
sweep can lay all the blame on him – it is easy enough to replace an
arrested apprentice.
Lucky Omens
Among urban folk throughout the Empire, it is generally considered
a good omen to meet a sweep first thing in the morning, as ancient
superstitions ties soot and ash to rebirth and fertility. This has led
to the bizarre ritual of some sweeps hiring themselves out to attend
weddings early in the morning to bring good fortune to the union. At
the marriage of a poor couple, a sweep can expect a free meal, but at
the extravagant weddings of the nobility, he can earn the equivalent of
a week’s wages. Sweeps often come to blows to be the first to present
themselves to the bride’s father before the wedding starts.
Adventure Seeds
Old Bones: A sweep is employed by a merchant to clean the longunused
chimneys of a mansion he has bought. One of the chimneys is

A Thief in the Chimney: A rake has gambled away his wife’s jeweller,
losing it to another nobleman. He hires a chimney sweep to enter the

Cloaked Brother
Really? There is a rumour going ‘round that poor Bertram is caught up in a cult? Tell

(ToC) Cloaked Brothers are hidden agents loosely affiliated with Sigmar’s Witch
Hunters. Though not a true branch of the Templars, they often have cause to join forces
with their, sometimes overzealous, brethren. However, they are just as likely to double
cross them as they are with any organisation they deal with. Cloaked Brothers are
masters of information. They infiltrate organisations to learn what they can, reporting
their findings to their superiors – though who exactly “they” are is unknown. This
organisation draws from a vast array of talent, from ex-Witch Hunters to Mutants.

Recruitment
The Cloaked Brothers do not exist, and that’s just the way the Cloaked
Brothers like it. The vast majority of the Empire has never heard of the
Brothers, and the tiny portion that has believes they exist only in beerfuelled
tavern tales. While their structure remains entirely concealed to
outsiders, the Cloaked Brothers are in fact a highly ordered fraternity.
The organisation only consider candidates for recruitment from among
long-standing friends and proven associates who possess knowledge or
skills that it values. Cloaked Brothers come from all walks of life, and
from both sides of the law. There are only two non-negotiable directives
that govern recruitment: The candidate must have experienced firsthand
contact or exposure to the ruinous powers, and the candidate
must be of temperate nature and evidence a personal history that
demonstrates caution over zeal, patience over urgency and restraint over
indulgence.
Recruits are always selected in groups of five to form the standard
Cloaked Brother cell. The Cloaked Brother who recruits a new cell
becomes its leader. This way, veteran cells that gain too much attention
or notoriety can be “retired” from active duty, yet still put their
members’ experience to use. The five members of a Cloaked Brother
cell will never meet face-to-face. Cell members know the name and
occupation of their cell-leader as well as the other members in their cell,
but no one else. In theory, this modular command structure should
ensure that individual cells are insulated from one another should a
breach in security occur.
Many Cloaked Brothers are trained in cryptography, and
communications with their cell-leader and fellow cell-members are
handled through an elaborate code scheme utilising a series of cipher
discs. A major limitation to early cryptography was that codes had to
be simple enough for recipients to decode without the help of advanced
academic knowledge. Famed Tilean scholar, Cosimo Baldacci, offered
an innovative solution in 1204, with his invention of the cipher disc.
The cipher disc is a device used for encoding and decoding messages
through the use of concentric wheels imprinted with alphabetic and
numeric characters. The Tilean City States make extensive use of cipher
discs to maintain the security of their diplomatic missives; however their
use is still limited in other regions.
A Cloaked Brother will hide his cipher disc in many places, including
inside rings, belt buckles, dagger hilts and even coat buttons. Cipher
discs are typically crafted from gold or other soft metals so they can be
quickly melted, trampled or otherwise defaced in the event of capture.
New Skill: Academic Knowledge (Cryptography)
Description: Cryptography is the art of disguising or “encoding”
information within a seemingly unrelated sequence of letters and
numbers known as a code. In theory, the intended recipient can only
read an encoded message through the use of a code key. However,
experienced cryptographers are often able to decipher or “decode” a
message through meticulous research and toil.

(Core) While the Empire is a mighty nation, its lands are far from safe. Large stretches of it have
never been pacified or cultivated. A precarious system of roads connects the villages, towns, and
cities, and it is here that the Coachmen earn their pay, working for one of the many Imperially
chartered coaching companies. The roads are frequently in ill repair or plagued by Goblins,
Beastmen, and brigands. Nonetheless, the Coachmen risk life and limb to bring passengers and cargo
safely through the hazards of the Imperial roadways. Each day is a race to reach the next settlement
or coaching inn before sunset. No one wants to be on the road in the dark of the night, especially
when the Chaos moon is in the sky.

A Day in the Life
A coachman starts his journey is one of the great cities of the Empire.
With his partner (coachmen typically work in pairs) , the coachman
prepares the coach for the journey, tend to the needs of the horses, and
help the passengers load their luggage and settle comfortably. Good
coachmen engage their passengers in witty repartee, inform them about
the journey ahead, and perhaps entertain them with a jolly tune on the
coach horn.
The coachmen have one task that they must achieve above all others,
to reach the next stage of their journey before night falls. After dark
the forests of the Empire come alive with the howls of wild animals,
beastmen, goblins, or worse. A lone coach makes an easy target for a
raiding party bent on destruction or loot.
Even during the daytime a coach is far from safe. Gangs of outlaws or
highwaymen sometimes block the roads, waiting for a coach to stop so
they can rob the passengers. To this end each coachman is ever vigilant
with his blunderbuss. After all, with such an intimidating weapon, only
the most desperate brigand would press his attack.
Affiliations
Most coachmen in the Empire are members of one of the great coaching
houses, such as Imperial Expressways of Nuln (a lavish and stately
service), Tunnelway Coaches of Talabheim (a rather limited local run),
or Ratchett Lines of Altdorf (a dilapidated shadow of its former self).
To be a member of a coaching house is to be a member of a guild in all
but name. They provide coaches, equipment, training, and wages to the
coachmen, and expect loyal service in return. The Houses also patronise
a number of coaching inns, fortified taverns that line the major coach
routes and provide stopping points for the night.
The most successful coaching house is Four Seasons Coaches, operating
out of Altdorf. From humble beginnings this company has become the
foremost coaching house in the Empire. Even the name “Four Seasons”
is something of a manifesto, as other houses run a limited service in
the harsh winter months. The company even sponsors its own chain of
coaching inns, making life for competitors even harder.
Adventure Seeds
A Little Dishonest Business: The travellers on a Ratchett Lines
coach from Altdorf to Delberz are in for a nasty shock. One of the

to an agreement with a gang of outlaws. Two days into the journey the
bandits descend on the coach. The coachman discharges his blunderbuss
harmlessly over their heads, leaving the outlaws free to take what they
wish from the passengers.
You Need to Get There Fast, Right? Cannon Ball Express coachmen
have come up with a way to add a little spice to a routine run. When
they leave Nuln they pick up a stamped card marked with the time of
departure that they later hand to a man at the Broken Lance, a coaching
inn on the outskirts of Kemperbad. Every four months the team who
made the run in the shortest time are awarded a crate of Bugman’s Ale
at a secret party in Nuln. The contest is just seen as a bit of fun, but
thrown horseshoes and damaged coaches can result if coaches pushed
too fast. It’s only a matter of time before a serious accident occurs,
leaving the coachmen and their passengers stranded in the wilderness,
far from the nearest coaching inn.

(Core) Courtiers surround the nobility at court, fawning over lieges and ladies in the hopes of
getting ahead. They range from sycophants who desperately wish to please, to cunning schemers
who seek the keys to wealth and prestige. Courtiers are frequently well-read and skilled public
speakers, as they are often called upon to offer erudite opinions on a variety of subjects to
their Noble patrons. No Courtier, no matter how clever, is ever fully secure in his position,
as there is always another who desperately wants it and is willing to do nearly anything to
get it. Female Courtiers are usually known as ladies-in-waiting.

The Valicinian Circle
This unmarked gated building in the most elite section of Altdorf is
often mistaken for a private residence. It is, in fact, a very exclusive
private club and gathering place for countless Courtiers. Named for an
ancient warrior-poet, the club is dominated by classical themes almost
designed to make the lower classes feel uncomfortable.
On the face of it, this is a harmless if extravagant organisation mostly
concerned with sipping fine Bretonnian brandy and discussing the
vagaries of the market. But many major decisions regarding business
and government are decided in these marble halls and so it should
be no surprise that villains of many varieties may be found here. A
Lamhian vampiress (see NDM for details) and courtier using the name
of Baroness Clarissa von Rosen is a prominent member who has slowly
been gaining noble and courtier thralls among the membership. It is
only a matter of time before the Circle is transformed into her personal
coven.
Venezia Falconieri
Venezia was born to the life of a courtier. The daughter of a family that
boasted seven generations of courtesans, the courtly life was simply in
her blood. Further Venezia is a classic beauty, dark-haired, emeraldeyed
and fair-skinned. She is undoubtedly one of the most physically
attractive women in the Old World today. Venezia leveraged her beauty
and wits and arose within the society of the Tilean city-state of Verezzo
like a force of nature.
She cut a magnificent swath through the nobility and upper society,
soon being able to claim that she was perhaps the most influential
woman in Verezzo save the Duchess. Perhaps, she rose a bit too
spectacularly. Powerful enemies decided she needed to be dealt with and
trumped up charges of witchcraft. Venezia barely managed to escape the
pyres of the witch hunters and was forced to forever flee the city of her
birth.
Thus did Venezia come to Altdorf. She resides there to this day, and her
company and talents are much sought after. It is said that if one must
negotiate the subtleties of the court of Karl Franz, there is no better
guide. Alas, one must be careful when dealing with the Lady Falconieri.
Any question reveals interest and that can be valuable information in its
own right.
Venezia has dozens of clients always ready to pay handsomely for
secrets. And what of the whispers of witchcraft? Could it be that the
trumped charges that caused to her flee Verezzo were not so imaginary
after all? What other explanation could there be for her sending her
personal valet to purchase strange herbs from the more discrete markets
of the city?

The Wrong Side of the Insult: One of the characters has insulted a

make the party miserable. They must either flee in disgrace or brave the
treacheries of high society and the local count’s court if they are deal
with this threat.
Urgent Retrieval: A courtier is desperate – his private journals have
been stolen. He is sure the theft was engineered by his rival to disgrace
him. He needs that journal (which is full of scandals and gossip) back

To be counted among their ranks one must be clever, ambitious and completely ruthless. Most claw their

A crime lord without a guild to command is no crime lord, but just a
thug with pretensions. Of course, the fact that all but the dimmest of
those he commands seeks his job is always on the crime lord’s mind. On
the other hand, he needs to surround himself with the most competent
rogues, scoundrels, and thugs he can find, or his guild will fall to some
other, rival, guild. The constant tension between needing to have
powerful subordinates – while making sure they are not too powerful –
defines the crime lord’s life, and only those who can master the balance
remain in this career for long.
In all but the smallest cities there are multiple guilds – and while
criminal organizations are, by nature, untrustworthy, naked self
interest helps prevent all-out wars. Each guild, band, or gang will try
to define its own territory or area of operation. The pickpockets of Old
Bend District can co-exist with the burglars there, and both will work
together against a new gang muscling in on their territory. At times,
particularly cunning and powerful crime lords build vast underworld
empires.
Every gang in the city swears fealty to them, often paying a “tax” from
their earning. The tax sometimes goes to keep the guards and bailiffs
well-bribed, but often it vanishes into the crime lord’s pockets. Such
webs of control are short lived, unless there are more powerful forces
behind the ”boss” – agents of Chaos, renegade wizards, and the like may
be the power behind the shadowy throne.
Little Known Facts
Crime lords often operate under many names and many aliases. A
criminal who has lost his gang in one city may start up a new one a few
leagues down the river, slightly disguised and possessing a new identity.
The most cunning crime lords will sometimes take on two identities in
the same city, using the second to find out who seeks to betray the first
by posing as his own “rival.”
Often, crime lords and agents of the law, such as bailiffs, end up
working together. Crime is unavoidable, but if the victims of crimes are
primarily those who are enemies of the city’s rulers, the law can easily
look the other way.
Adventure Seeds
Cleaning Up: A seemingly incorruptible politician has seized power,
and he is ordering crackdowns on all the local gangs – even those who
have long had “cozy” relations with the law. Corrupt officers are being
stripped of their rank and hidden allies among the burghers are being
outed! Is this new leader truly what he seems, or is he just sweeping out
all remnants of the old criminal order so that he can establish his own
gang?
The Game: The old capo is retiring while he’s still alive, a rare thing.
He doesn’t want to see the great criminal empire he’s built crumble into
warring gangs, so he decides to appoint a successor – someone who
has the cunning and daring needed to inspire and lead. A powerful
Ostermark noble and her retinue, will be paying a visit soon – whoever
manages to steal the most from them will be the designated “heir.” Of
course, the local law has been made aware of the “contest” – but they
must not allow the noblewoman to know it is going on. The game is
afoot...

Crusader
Shall mankind’s lot be to sit idle and let the darkness take him? No, I say thee! We must
strike back against the shadows!
(ToS) It is perhaps the greatest deed a templar can perform to go to war in the name
of the Gods. In ages past, especially during the crusades against Araby, it was
unusual for a knight to not go on crusade with his order. But in more recent
times crusades are far less common, especially on such a scale.
Crusaders are those knights who are veterans of crusades, who have
earned great glory for their order and faith through their deeds in
foreign lands against the enemies of the cult. They are world-wise
men, skilled at fighting in all manner of conditions and against all
manner of enemies, and many knights who return from crusade find their deeds
forever etched in the legends of their order.
Not all crusaders hail from the nobility or from a knightly order, although it is certainly
true that most do. Some are pious men who are mere soldiers, fighting alongside the armies of
templars and knights, and their deeds are no less noble despite their lesser status.

Crusader Patrons and the Economics of Faith
Although crusades are usually declared by a religious order, many of
the knights who join them are driven by worldly motives like revenge
or the pursuit of glory. Crusaders from the Empire typically belong to
Sigmarite or Ulrican orders such as the Knights Panther or Knights of
the White Wolf.
Crusaders from the southern lands of Estalia and Tilea are almost
entirely from the Myrmidian Order of the Righteous Spear. Bretonnian
crusaders fight on behalf of their liege lords and the Lady of the Lake,
rather than belonging to organised knightly orders. The lands north of
Kislev have become a popular destination for crusaders from across the
Old World since the Storm of Chaos.
Crusades are costly endeavours, often requiring significant investment
from nobles and merchants. Religious orders lacking the resources to
supply ships and baggage trains themselves must guarantee treasure or
parcels of land to potential financiers. Wealthy benefactors who wish to
have their interests properly represented provide soldiers led by knights
from their own armies, or even accompany the crusade in person. The
cult of Sigmar is the only religious order with sufficient wealth to launch
a crusade without the backing of others, although the temples’ coffers
would be depleted by such an endeavour, so the patronage of nobles is
generally solicited.
Echoes of Araby
Every crusader knows of the crusades against Araby nearly 1,000 years
ago which were launched in retaliation for Sultan Jaffar’s invasion of
Estalia. Few realise the extent to which those crusades still influence the
customs of knightly orders today. The Knights Panthers’ symbolic cat
pelts are intended to commemorate their crusader forebears, but the
order also practises ritualistic hand gestures before meals to bless their
food and drink. In modern times, these gestures are accompanied by
prayers to Taal and Rhya, but originally they were used in spells by the
crusaders’ hedge sorcerers to appease desert spirits. Present day crusaders
of the Knights Panther wear grilled visors on their helms as a matter of
tradition, but during the Arabyan crusades this was merely a precaution
against heat stroke.
When the Arabyan port city of Copher was ransacked during the
original crusades, both civilians and wounded soldiers were slain
without quarter. The grandmasters of the Righteous Spear agreed at
the time that the killings at Copher constituted murder, not war, and
warned their knights against the temptations of the dread god Khaine.
The Order of the Righteous Spear has a longstanding policy amongst its
crusaders to always accept a human enemy’s surrender.
Adventure Seeds
Greenskins: A Waaagh! led by orc warboss Grimgor Ironhide left
a wake of ruined villages across the Empire. A place sacred to the
crusader’s god was despoiled by the orc marauders, and its priests are
now organising a crusade to exact revenge. The cult’s templars argue
that precious resources must not be squandered as long as remnants of
Archaon’s Chaos horde remain in the Empire’s forests.
Handrich’s First Crusade: A cabal of Marienburg merchants is funding
a crusade to secure the Ivory Road to Ind. This is the first crusade
to be launched in the name of Handrich, whose cult does not have
any templar orders of its own. The merchants are therefore recruiting
independent knights to lead the crusade.

Cult Attendant
Are they attacking now? No? Then you can tell the high priest about the rampaging mutants after
morning prayers.
(ToS) A cult attendant is an assistant to a cult’s priests, entrusted with organising all of the
mundane details involved in the running of a temple. Cult attendants are concerned with the
logistical side of a cult, organising orders of service, coordinating the activities of the clergy and
the laity, and ensuring that rituals and prayers proceed as smoothly as possible. A cult attendant rules
behind the scenes of a temple, and many pride themselves on remaining as inconspicuous as
possible.

A Day in the Life
On an ideal day, the cult attendant attends to the many chores required
to ensure the smooth running of his temple, such as the mundane tasks
of keeping the temple clean and in good repair. But the attendant must
also be prepared to serve the spiritual needs of the temple’s visitors.
Ideal days are rare, however. It is not uncommon for a priest to fail
to show up for a service they should be conducting. This occurs most
often with militant priests, who are devoted to both their faith and
the battlefield. Sometimes finding a replacement is just a matter of
finding a priest in the temple and pointing him in the direction of the
congregation, but sometimes messengers must be sent out to find a
priest, any priest, and bring him in. Even a wandering priest of the god
might be drafted in to fill a gap.
Theft is another concern. While perhaps not as rampant as some may
make it out to be, theft from temples and the faithful does occur.
This presents two problems for the cult attendant. The most urgent
is replacing the missing supplies, because the theft may not even be
discovered until someone tries to use the item stolen. Finding the thief
is also important, in an effort to both recover losses as well as put an end
to the thefts.
Little Known Facts
Particularly skilled or efficient cult attendants may find themselves
courted by larger, wealthier temples. It’s not at all unheard of for an
attendant to leave one church altogether in favor of another that pays
better, as the Church of Ulric is learning to its dismay in Middenheim.
A cult attendant need not be officially ordained in the cult he serves. In
fact, many cult attendants started as members of the congregation who
took a special interest in the affairs of the temple.
The cult attendant is under an enormous amount of stress, trying to
balance expenses, keep the temple provisioned and maintained, while
catering to the egos of priests, friars and prelates all making demands on
the attendant’s time and resources.
Even faithful cult attendants may succumb to the ennui of their role
within a given order. They feel a burning need to make a difference for
their faith, and more than one cult attendant has shirked that role to
take up arms, filled with a righteous zeal. Lacking the military training
of their brethren, these former cult attendants often end up as martyrs
for their faith.
Adventure Seeds
Convictions: The cult attendant notices a drop in offerings on certain
days, and quickly realises that the fall coincides with two particular
people being on duty. One is a respected priest, the other a newlyrecruited
initiate with a shady past. The attendant suspects one of
them may be stealing from the offertory, but cannot be certain without
proof. The cult attendant wants to “hire” some new members of the
congregation to help get to the bottom of things.
An Unsettling Discovery: A cult attendant is cataloguing the contents
of a recent delivery. Among the mundane foodstuffs and supplies is
a box of votive candles. Upon opening the box, the cult attendant
discovers that the candles are formed of a sickly sweet violet wax and
bear the sigil of Slaanesh! How did these candles get mixed in with the
temple’s supplies? Did someone deliberately acquire them, looking to
subvert members of the faith?

Daemon Slayer
A Slayer Finally Meets his Doom
When a daemon slayer finally meets his doom, his surviving
companions should decide how to honour him. It would certainly be
remiss of them not to contact the dwarf’s family and old associates to
tell them of the manner of his passing.
Such a journey could be perilous in itself, as the dwarf holds lie in
remote mountainsides. The reception may not be a warm one either,
and if the news is not good (for example the slayer may have died in a
dishonourable manner – by accident or in combat with an unworthy
foe) the dwarfs might hold it against the messenger.
Notable Figure: Falki Ringulsson
Falki Ringulsson was a young apprentice stonemason of Karak Hirn.
His master, Gotri, allowed Falki to oversee the completion of a joist they
erected in a feasting hall. Five months later, during raucous celebrations,
part of the roof gave way and crushed the revellers underneath.
It seemed his joist had proved the weak point and Falki blamed himself.
Gotri tried to console his apprentice, explaining that accidents happen,
but Falki fell into a deep depression and took no solace from anyone’s
sympathy. After months of his apprentice’s moping Gotri suggested
making atonement might ease his apprentice’s conscience. He didn’t
mention any particular penance, but everyone knew what was implied.
Falki shaved the sides of his head, dyed his hair a bright orange, and
swore the slayer oath. He travelled to exotic locales, met wondrous
beasts, and slew them.
Seventeen years later, few dwarfs from Karak Hirn would recognise
the now mighty Falki Ringulsson. He has faced down some of the
most dreadful opponents the Old World has to offer and has earned
the title of daemon slayer. However, a secret bitterness lurks in Falkri’s
heart. No longer a callow youth, he now considers Gotri responsible
for the accident that led to his shame, reasoning that the master mason
convinced him to take the oath to focus blame on Falki. If the mason
had taken his responsibilities seriously he would have checked that his
apprentice’s work was sound. Falki wants one last meeting with Gottri
before meeting his doom.
Adventure Seeds
Suffer No Guilt: A party of dwarfs cross the path of the daemon
slayer, and to his horror, he recognises that one of them knows of the
great shame that led him to taking the Slayer oath. The dwarfs reassure
the daemon slayer they are not angry. They have sought him out and
they wish to talk. They explain that there were mistakes made in the
past and the daemon slayer’s name has been cleared – he was not
responsible for the dishonour he feels he must atone for. The dwarfs
are not so naïve as to believe any slayer would ever turn his back on his
oath, but they want him to know he can go to his doom with a clear
conscience.
A Scholarly Approach: A daemon slayer increasingly worries about
what tales he leaves to prosperity, and seeks out ever-rarer opponents in
order to find his doom at the hands of a truly remarkable foe. Daemon
slayers have even been observed taking an interest in the subject of
Beastaria, poring over illustrated tomes of fabulous beasts in the library
of the Altdorf University. Such individuals may even chase rumours of
beasts that University professors claim are extinct or never even existed,
such as the fabled Jabberwock or the half-daemonic Fen Cyclops.
Daemon Slayer
Phaw. That weren’t so tough. Wake me when we find something worthy of my axe.
(Core) In every generation there are one or two Slayers who cannot seem to find the death they crave. At
every turn, destiny cheats them or perhaps, drives them forward, and as the long years pass, they grow
more and more fierce, determined to find the mighty doom that awaits them. When neither Trolls nor
Giants can fell a Slayer, he takes on the mightiest foes of all: the Daemons of Chaos. Daemon Slayers are
frightening individuals. They are barely sane at best, the shame of their continuing survival weighing ever
on their thoughts, yet they’re also among the greatest warriors that the Old World has ever known.
Note: Only Dwarfs can enter this career. You must have slain a Daemon of note to enter this career.

To see the sun again after a long Deepwatch. Was ne’er a shinier gold crown, nor richer reward.
(WC) The Deepwatch is made up of those too caught-up in the tales of adventure and
glory to pay heed to the inherent dangers, or those too desperate to care. The Deepwatch
are in essence a guild of professional adventurers, with groups dispatched into the tunnels

the city. It’s a dangerous job, all right, but somebody has to do it.
With your GM’s permission, you can substitute Deepwatcher for Militiaman as

A Day in the Life
Life beneath Tobaro resembles the worst any settlement has to offer,
with all the added dangers of cavern exploration and the regulation of
military service. Life in the Deepwatch is hardly the adventure some
paint it to be. True, one can reap the rewards of undiscovered treasures
or long-buried secrets, but just as easily gained are deaths from collapses,
monsters, or explosions of pent-up gasses.
The day begins at shiftstart – shifts start at dawn, mid-day, sunset, or
midnight – and ends two shiftstarts later. At any time of day, there are
more than a score of groups patrolling the undercaverns beneath Tobaro
and twice as many resting or in reserve.
Deepwatchers assemble in the guild hall or in a location beneath it
determined by their squad’s leaders – rare veterans who survive more
than six months in this career. Squads consist of four to a dozen folk.
One member maps out the squad’s route, another sketches details
and findings, and all others keep weapons and ropes at the ready for
anything.
One-third of the squads are on the “shortshift” of single-night patrols.
They tour familiar points beneath the city that are known areas of
activity for thieves or other threats to the city above. They also guard
the wells to prevent anyone from poisoning the populace. These shifts
are considered “reward posts” in that the areas traveled are shallow, wellknown,
and unlikely to collapse or present major problems. Therefor,
these shifts often precede a longer posting.
The other two-thirds of the squads are on “longshifts.” These involve
a shift’s travel (or more) to and from Deepwatch camps (used for
resting without returning to the city). There are between nine and a
dozen “shift-holds,” depending on whether or not they are overrun by
monsters or abandoned for other reasons. While there are often supplies
and weapons in each shift-hold, squads carry in food and fuel for
themselves, leaving behind only obvious surpluses.
One-third the longshifts guard the shift-holds and immediate tunnels
around them. The remaining active squads delve into unexplored places.
Those squads root out any monsters or collapsed tunnels too dangerous
to defend or clear. They also look for new threats to report to the guild
hall far above. A typical longshift is no less than two shifts beyond
the time it takes to reach their shift-hold. Deepwatchers collect their
paychecks after each longshift.
Affiliations
The official chain-of-command for the Deepwatch only mentions the
Commander and three sub-Commanders as responsible for assigning
squads to the undercity. Unofficially, veteran Deepwatchers become
informal officers over habitual parties. It’s understood who works
regularly with whom and said groups adopt names such as Dhorrin’s
Delvers, Guild Havenrold’s Deepers, the Ratbanes, or Contano’s Band.
Adventure Seeds
House Checcin’s Rise: Numerous gem merchants and whitesmiths
have disappeared in recent months. Rumors fly that House Checcin
has been consolidating its power over the jewelry trade in Tobaro by
assassinating its rivals and disposing of the bodies beneath the city.
Whether Deepwatchers or others are complicit in these assassinations,
the increase in traffic beneath Tobaro also increases the dangers for any
moving beneath the city.

Demagogue
Surely, good people, you will not tolerate this injustice in our town?
(Core) Demagogues are the most popular Agitators, public speakers so gifted that they can move
countries with their persuasive words. They are always counted among the leaders of whatever cause
they choose to champion. Those in power view Demagogues with a great deal of suspicion, as they are
far too capable of stirring up dissent or sowing mistrust against the government or the church. If they
can be properly directed however, they’re also very useful for rallying the people against Chaos and
other threats. Thus the authorities treat popular Demagogues with caution and sometimes even
favour.

Little Known Facts
As supremely convincing public speakers, demagogues can inspire
rage or grief, create an angry mob or turn an enraged crowd to tears of
shame. Magistrates are well aware of prevailing public opinion, and are
sometimes swayed in their decisions when a demagogue has riled up
the public against the likely judgment of the courts. Wise rulers will
ensure that particularly effective demogogues are in his employ and well
satisfied.
Anyone with an axe to grind can hire a demagogue to speak to the
crowds on their behalf. Not all demagogues are so mercenary, however;
some are true believers in their cause be it the plight of the peasants,
the abuses of the wealthy or support for the monarchy. These men and
women will work tirelessly for their cause, and will suffer hardships and
privation in the hope of making the world a better place.
Such crusaders can be dangerous to the status quo, especially if their
interests are counter to those of the people in power. Demagogues can
expect to spend at least part of their lives in prison, and would do well
to have few possessions to facilitate leaving town at a moment’s notice
and ahead of the city watch. Rivalries often occur between demagogues
supporting opposing factions in a dispute, as each tries to raise the
crowd in anger against the other.
A Day in the Life
Demagogues not in the direct employ of the wealthy or influential
usually live a hand-to-mouth existence, often taking goods or services
in barter for their efforts on behalf of another rather than actual money.
Demagogues employed by nobles, churches and the well-to-do typically
leads lives of relative leisure, but are expected to be ready to orate at a
moment’s notice when called upon. They are not exactly welcome at
court, though putting in the occasional appearance, flirting and making
chit-chat at less prestigious parties and holidays, can help bolster the
standing of their master with his peers.
In many cases the noble in question may wish to keep his patronage
of the demagogue secret. This serves to maintain the illusion that the
demagogue is impartial, allowing him to seem sincere in supporting his
“dear friend’s” wishes on the matter.
Adventure Seeds
Troublesome Talk: A skilled orator is stirring up resentment against
the Emperor, the Electors, and the local magistrates. The party is hired
to follow this person and learn more about him. His true patron,
a difficult matter to discover, is secretly a high priest of one of the
proscribed cults, and the demagogue himself may even have a mutation
or two to hide.
The Plague: A dreadful plague has broken out in Altdorf, and a
talented, charming demagogue is encouraging townspeople to do things
that will help the disease to spread, such as travelling to other towns and
ignoring strict sanitation rules. The demagogue is being blackmailed
by the skaven, who hold something so damning over his head that he
cannot refuse their orders. The party must stop him or convince him to
turn things around before the city is filled only with the dead, and the
new masters of Altdorf are the villainous rat-men!

Dilettante
This reminds me of something interesting that von Halmith wrote, and... Oh! Is that Griffon’s Bane?
(New) Dilettantes like to think of themselves as scholars, and, indeed, they may pass as scholars among most folk; they
read and write, for a start. However, they often lack the discipline or passion that leads true scholars to focus on one
task and become truly skilled at that, rather spreading their efforts across many. Most dilettantes are from
wealthy backgrounds; the poor find that imminent starvation focuses the mind wonderfully.
A dilettante prides himself on knowing a little bit about almost everything, starting a variety of
projects, pursuing a dozen interests at the same time. A dilettante is a professional amateur –
interested in the arts, the burgeoning field of science, literature, religion, and virtually any other
topic. At least, until another subject matter comes along and grabs their attention.

Affiliations
Dilettantes love to mingle with professionals involved to their current
pursuits. In particular, they love being members of associations, guilds
or clubs that afford a measure of prestige and help justify their interests.
Unfortunately for them, most of the prestigious guilds or colleges look
down upon dilettantes, who they regard as having none of the discipline
and application needed to truly master a subject. Although dilettantes
resent this, the charge is normally true.
As a result, many found their own groups, with impressive sounding
titles, such as ”The Bernloch Academy of Art, Science and Engineering”.
A person with the right background, connections and scholarly
pretensions can join one of these groups by paying the often exorbitant
entry fee.
Occasionally, someone genuinely talented in some field of study applies
to join, and is accepted in order to boost the reputation of the group.
The entry fee might even be waived for such a candidate.
The associations are effectively social clubs, although they make a
show of having their members present their “research” to the meetings.
Scholars who can tolerate poseurs find these associations a relaxing
place where scholarship is respected, and just occasionally they hear
something very interesting from the other members.
Hieronymus von Bernloch
The founder of the recently established Bernloch Academy of Art,
Science and Engineering, Hieronymus is a large man in his middle
years. He inherited a great deal of money from his father, who was the
head of a moderately successful merchant company. A soft upbringing
allowed Hieronymus to pursue his many different interests, and over the
years he has dabbled in almost every field of study there is.
Unlike many dilettantes, Hieronymus is at least self-aware enough to
know that he lacks the application to become an expert on anything.
However, he enjoys knowing a bit about everything, from astrology to
obscure merchant guild bylaws, and likes being able to talk intelligently
with experts on almost any subject. If true experts apply to join his
academy, he eagerly supports them, even those expelled from officially
sanctioned guilds. His willingness to turn a blind eye to someone’s
past has brought some interesting people into the Bernloch Academy.
It’s rumoured that there is even a necromancer and an Elven poisoner
within its members.
Adventure Seeds
A Dark Past: A dilettante decides to write a book on the local history
of his town. He begins research, but before he has written anything
down he endures a remarkable run of bad luck, getting caught up in
accidents that threaten his health or even his life. He is convinced
someone is organising the accidents. It seems there is something in the
town’s history that someone wants kept quiet. These events have turned
the man craven, and he seeks help to conduct research on his behalf and
unearth the dark past he’s sure exists.
Hidden Talents: A dilettante turns her hand to painting. Her first
work is mediocre, at best. The second painting is brilliant. She sees the
difference herself, but cannot understand it. The same is true of the
third painting, although there are disturbing undertones to the image.
The trend continues, and people start whispering about pacts with dark
powers. The dilettante gets nervous; she doesn’t remember making any
pacts with dark powers, but what’s going on with the painting?

(RotIQ) Great herds of domesticated animals endlessly cross the wind-swept
oblast, escorted from pasture to market, from market to customer. The tireless drovers overseeing these
transfers can travel many hundred of miles with their herds, and some even visit distant markets in

the distinctive barks and whistles used to control these hounds are a familiar sound on the oblast.
In the civilised south there are regular competitions between drovers to see who can best herd
animals with their dogs, and the winner is guaranteed the most lucrative contracts.

A Day in the Life
A drover spends much of his time in the saddle, the pitiless oblast
stretching out around him, his eyes constantly searching the horizon for
danger. He leads his herd in search of food, scratching what sustenance
he can from the barren oblast, protecting his animals against extremes
of weather and predatory wildlife until it is time to take the livestock on
their long journey to market.
It is a never-ending cycle and one that hones a drover’s knowledge of the
tundra and steppes to a razor’s edge. Herdsmen of the Empire would
quail at some of the challenges the drover must face during his day. A
drover is sometimes forced to push his herd for days at a time before
finding a suitable place for his animals to graze.
When drovers meet in the vast lonely stretches of the oblast, it is an
occasion for much rejoicing. Often they will have an impromptu feast
and spend hours challenging each other to feats of skill with horse and
herd. Such meetings last only for a single night, however. Once dawn
breaks, the drovers must press on, finding new pastures to graze their
herds and new markets in which to sell them.
A Drover and His Herd
Most drovers tend to favour one kind of animal above all others,
whether they are sheep, long-haired cows, goats or another of the many
kinds of herd animals common to Kislev. With his animals, horse and
dog, a drover forms a tightly knit unit.
A drover and his dog, especially, form an inseparable bond, and through
the course of a drover’s life, though he may own several dogs, typically
they will all be littered from his first one. A drover comes to trust
his dog with his life and his herd, and the faithful dog becomes an
extension of his mastery over animals and his skill at controlling them.
A drover knows that his herd is his life. It feeds him, gives him coin and
provides him at least some small company on the oblast. In the deep of
the night, it also keeps him warm; drovers quickly become indifferent to
the stink of the herd when it means not freezing to death.
When faced with peril, most drovers run their herds and tackle the
danger themselves if they can. However, some especially skilled and
daring drovers attempt to use their herds as weapons. With a few wellplaced
yells and whistles, a drover and his faithful dog can turn a mob
of terrified animals into an unstoppable tide of snouts, horns and hoofs.
This can be particularly daunting for the hapless bandit or predator that
suddenly finds themselves facing a wall of fear-maddened herd animals
Adventure Seeds
Disappearing Drovers: A commonly used passage across the oblast has
suddenly become dangerous and several drovers and their herds have
been lost. If someone can locate the problem and re-open the passage,
the local atamans are sure to make it worth their while.
The Amazing Graze: With the turning of the seasons comes a great
migration of herds from the southern pastures to the great grasslands
of the northern oblast. Though there are countless places to graze, only
a few areas are prized for their safety, shelter and ample vegetation.
Getting to these first can be an adventure in itself as drovers push their
herds hard through the thawing landscape.

Duellist
Didst thou besmirch my good name with your ill-timed jest? I surely hope so...
(Core) A complex legal system of formal duels was established throughout the Empire ages ago.
Duellists are specialists in the lethal application of sword and pistol, hiring themselves out to safeguard
the honour of others, though many of their kind come from the ranks of younger Nobles who duel
for their own purposes. Duellists come in two varieties: happy-go-lucky devil-may-care swashbucklers
who regard their exploits as a continuous adventure, and deadly serious fighters who wear their
honour on their sleeves and are very quick to take offence at slights, imagined or otherwise.

Affiliations
Formal duelling has a very specific structure and complex set of rules
governing its performance. Duellists must follow all these rules if
they hope to avoid being branded common murderers, which means
they must know the rules thoroughly. Because of this, the single most
important organisation for any duellist is a proper duelling school. Only
a handful of such schools exist, each fully certified and approved by the
local Elector-Count, and in some cases by the Emperor himself.
All duellists belong to a duelling school, where they learn the rules and
also practice their skills. Each duelling school has its own preferred
fighting style and methods, and a good duellist can tell an opponent’s
school by watching him duel or even practice. Duelling schools also
provide a place where nobles and merchants can go to hire duellists
– the school takes a small commission for arranging the meeting and for
guaranteeing the duellist is a professional and will behave accordingly.
They do not guarantee victory, of course.
Many duellists also belong to duelling associations. These are less
formal organizations, simply collections of duellists who share common
interests and like to gather to compare stories, techniques, and tips.
Most duelling associations only admit duellists from a single duelling
school, and often rivalries spring up between different associations. The
associations also provide opportunities to spar with other duellists, and
some nobles prefer to hire through these organizations rather than going
to the schools.
Notable Figures
Perhaps the two most famous living duellists are Fieran of the Flashing
Eye and Danigan Darkmane. Fieran is the idol of most swashbucklerstyle
duellists. He is handsome and flamboyant, with red-gold hair,
a neat beard, and flashing blue eyes. He always dresses in the latest
style and the finest clothes, and when he is not duelling he is drinking
and carousing, usually with young noblemen (and noblewomen). In
battle, Fieran fights with a sword and main gauche and he is certainly
skilled . However, he also likes to show off, going for more elaborate
manoeuvres than necessary and seeking to entertain rather than finish a
bout quickly.
Danigan Darkmane is Fieran’s antithesis in many ways. A tall,
powerfully built man with craggy features and a hundred scars, Danigan
dresses in dark leathers to match his thick, shaggy black hair. He is a
serious duellist, not given to frivolity at all, and in battle he attacks
at once, going for the kill as quickly as possible. Even when he is not
duelling Danigan is quick to battle, taking offense easily and violently.
He has few friends, though many admire his combat skills – preferably
from a distance.
Adventure Seeds
A Death Out of Context: The duellist is hired for a formal duel – but
his intended opponent is found dead the morning before the face-off!
Now the duellist is suspected of murder, even though he would have
fought the man legally a few hours later. Can he prove his innocence?
Vengeance for the Masters: Someone has destroyed the duellist’s
duelling school, killing the instructors and administrators and burning
the buildings to the ground. Now the duellist and all his surviving
schoolmates want revenge. But who is responsible? And can a group of
duellists work together without killing each other?

Take yer horse or cow dung. Good fertiliser and it burns well when dried, if’n you don’t mind

(FoN) Ensuring the streets are clean, these brave workers walk the alleys

certainly not glorious, Dung Collectors often make do by selling dried
dung as cheap fuel through the winters.

Affiliations
Due to the aromatic nature of their work, Dung Collectors find that they
have few friends. However, bonepickers sifting through the rubbish and
midden heaps tend to have similar habits and frequent some of the same
areas, so the two groups tend to keep each other informed of things that
may prove of interest to the other.
Dung Collectors may have a similar working arrangement with rat
catchers, especially those that frequent the same sewer systems. Though
even a rat catcher rarely spares the time to swap gossip with the likes of
a Dung Collector.
Even amongst the poorest of the poor, there is a pecking order. Despised
and reviled for their stench and disgusting career, cities are far more
relient on the lowly Dung Collector than officials would care to admit.
Without their dirty work, insect and rat populations would explode into
even greater numbers, bringing all manner of disease and filth.
A Day in the Life
Dung Collectors make their modest living by clearing the streets of such
organic matter, and carting it outside the city walls where it can be
dumped unceremoniously, far enough away that the smell only drifts
back in when the wind is right. Clever Dung Collectors will sell their
dung to farmers who fertilize their fields with it, and many also dry the
larger bits and sell them to the poor as cheap winter fuel.
Dung Collectors spend their days pushing their collection cart from
street to street, scooping up one steaming pile and moving on to the
next. On parade or feast days, Dung Collectors watch the route of the
parade carefully, and make sure that anything dropped in their district is
collected quickly so as not to offend the eye of someone important.
There is never nothing at all for a Dung Collector to do, though some
days the workload is lighter than others. Dung Collectors tend to live
far outside of the city walls, closer to the dung disposal area than to
anything else. There they can track the progress of their drying dung,
and keep an eye open in the unlikely event that someone tries to steal
some.
Adventure Seeds
A Blind Eye: Leaflets are going up all over the city accusing the city
watch of protecting a murderer from justice because he happens to be a
noble. The accusations – whether true or false – are stirring up anger in
the general populace, and rioting is soon to follow unless this is nipped
in the bud before it explodes into full-blown anarchy. The party poses
as Dung Collectors, whom no one pays any attention to so their actions
– even obviously watching someone – are likely to go unnoticed. If they
can catch this anonymous leafleteer and turn him over to the watch,
there will be a substantial cash reward.
Foul Plans: Dung Collectors live their lives surrounded by filth. It
may come as no surprise then, that they might turn to the Lord of
Decay and Corruption, Nurgle, in time of need. Someone is “sowing”
Nurglings all over the city, and their foul antics are helping to spread
pestilence and disease to every corner of the town. The party must find
the Dung Collector responsible for bringing Nurglings into the city and
turn him over to the authorities, before a full-blown plague wipes out
half the population.

Embalmer
So beautiful, so exquisite… Notice the skin. It retains all the warmth, all the pliability she possessed in life. Why it’s almost
as if your beloved were alive again, my lord.
(NDM) Not everyone wishes to be interred in Morr’s Gardens. Some prefer a more preserving process after their
death, for themselves or their animal companions, and they turn to the embalmers. These masters of pickling,
preservation, and taxidermy are not just a fad of the wealthy. The individuals increasingly have a hand in the
growing field of medicine, and money can be made hand over fist in selling their curios to customers with a
particular purpose in mind. Many priests of Morr (and much of the general population) consider cutting bits off
people and putting them in jars to be an assault on both the body and spirit of the deceased, and Witch Hunters
are well aware of how easily such merchants turn to the dark arts. As such, many embalmers choose to hide their
Human exhibits behind their animal displays or their surgery services until the day scientists of their calibre are
finally given the respect and recognition they deserve.
Embalmers don’t usually encounter the Undead, but they work hand-in-glove with grave robbers and tomb
robbers who often do. They also tend to know a lot of necromancers – not that they would ever reveal their
customer’s identity, of course.

Ruprecht Klotten
This weasely little man is easy enough to ignore. Always dressed in
black, pale-skinned and scowling, it is easy to mistake Ruprecht as a
villain or at least someone to be avoided. This would be a mistake, for
Herr Klotten is an incredibly useful man to know. Ruprecht is a barbersurgeon
who turned to embalming after he discovered that he preferred
his patients dead and quiet.
This does not change the fact that he is an expert healer, doctor and
surgeon. His rates are reasonable and he doesn’t ask questions, making
him far superior to the reputable (and often less skilled) physicians who
are likely to report sword wounds and gun shot injuries to the watch.
Ruprecht Klotten has an Intelligence of 55%, has taken Skill Mastery
in Heal and has the Surgery talent. He charges half the rate of a normal
physician (see WFRP page 121) and is very discrete. His only downsides
are his unpleasant bedside manner and that he does his work right next
to his corpses. His morgue is spotlessly clean but can be unnerving to
the uninitiated. Stories that he sells the corpses of those he could not
save to necromancers must surely be only stories.
The Resurrection Men
If there are to be any advances in anatomy and modern medicine,
physicians need corpses to study. But the process of acquiring cadavers is
not a pleasant one for these highly educated gentlemen of science. So to
whom do they turn? The Resurrection Men are one part grave robbers
and one part criminal syndicate.
There is almost no way in the Empire today to legally acquire a corpse
for medical study; a few condemned prisoners are turned over, but
the demand for these is high and inevitably these corpses end up in
the hands of only the well-connected. Anyone else must confine their
researches purely to the theoretical or turn to the Resurrection Men.
Embalmers play a key role in this organisation, for it is they who know
what corpses can be stolen with little fuss. They also prepare the corpses,
ensuring that putrefaction does not spoil its value. Rarely are they the
actual thieves – they leave that grisly task to the grave robbers. There is
no doubt that there is real money to be made, as a properly prepared
corpse sold to a rich physician is worth ten gold crowns at least. Of
course, the Resurrection Men are despised as ghouls and vandals, but
as long as there is money in dead flesh, you can be assured that this
trade will continue.
Adventure Seeds
Dealing with the Dead: The characters seek the aid of a Priest of Morr
or Amethyst Wizard to help explain the purpose of a bizarre artefact
they have recovered from a lost crypt. Alas, no such people are easily
available to them, but it is rumoured that the city’s embalmers have
dealings with people of that “sort” and may be able to help. It won’t be
easy to convince an embalmer to give up his clientele, but perhaps one
of them needs a favour.
Beyond Blackmail: An embalmer and Resurrection Man has taken to
blackmailing some of his clientele, no longer happy with merely the
money for the corpses themselves. The physicians need someone to
silence their blackmailer. They’ve learned their lesson though, and they
plan to do away with whoever deals with the embalmer. It is best to
leave no loose ends.

Enforcer
I don’t care what Prince Olbert says about the border. This here’s part of the free lands of Southwick,
and yer tresspassing. That’s a hefty fine or seven lashes. I’ll let you choose.
(RC) Enforcers wander the Border Princes, providing justice or, failing that,
vengeance. Or sometimes they just provide random violence, because anyone can
make a mistake. On the whole, however, Enforcers have a code of right and wrong
that they uphold. They pay no attention to the legal authority of princes or, indeed,
to law, relying entirely on their own sense of ethics and ability to uncover true villains.
Most Enforcers regard rogue Enforcers as the blackest of villains because their actions
mean that any Enforcer is at risk of being run out of an area.
Enforcers are almost never found outside the Border Princes because the authorities
elsewhere take a very dim view of people taking the law into their own hands. The authorities in
the Border Princes do, too, but they generally can’t do anything about it.

A Day in the Life
The enforcer patrols the settlement where he resides, alert for any
criminal activity. The enforcer is an intimidating figure, but he may
win the affection of the populace through his vigilante work. They may
extend him favours, feed him, and buy him drinks. Just as likely they
could fear him, seeing him as a petty tyrant on the make who resorts to
violence to ensure compliance.
Should the enforcer spot any malcontents, he takes action. He may
administer an immediate punitive beating, or trail the perpetrator and
attack at a convenient moment. The Enforcer may help himself to his
victims’ belongings and purse when he finishes, justifying the theft as
covering the expenses of his lifestyle.
In some cases enforcers band together, forming a vigilante posse that
travels around a group of settlements, dispensing their own brand of
justice when and where it suits them.
The enforcer walks a very fine line, seeing himself as a watchman
keeping the law in a lawless land. More often he is little better than a
common thug, justifying acts of violence with flimsy pretences.
Notable Figure: Marco di Tantivelli
Generations ago, the di Tantivellis’ were a powerful noble family in
the Tilean republic, but their influence has long since diminished.
Progressives within Reman society have labelled the nobility as
potentially violent elements, and even seek to have them banned.
Tiring of the attacks on his family, Marco di Tantivelli decided to
relocate to the Border Princes, hoping to carve out a little kingdom for
himself so that he could live as a Reman noble of old.
For the first few years Marco’s burgeoning community flourished, but
then the greenskins came. A horde of ravaging Orcs carved a bloody
swathe through the nascent realm, despoiling Marco’s estate and
carrying off his wife and children into the wilderness. Marco attempted
to start over, but a neighbouring prince assembled a small army and
conquered what remained of his lands, justifying the act as “essential for
the security of the borders.”
Left penniless, friendless, and not a little mad, Marco developed a bitter
sense of justice, seeing the world in black and white terms of right and
wrong. Now he wanders the Borderlands as a ragged avenger, looking to
dispense punishment on those he views as guilty .
Adventure Seeds
More Than He Bargained For: An enforcer arrives to a tavern to
confront a violent thug demanding money and menacing the customers.
The enforcer dispenses a punitive beating but learns the man is just a
scout, and a group of bandits are due to arrive in town, very soon. The
enforcer will have to think fast if he is not to find himself pitted against
an angry group of outlaws.
Your Kind Isn’t Welcome Here: A posse of enforcers may arrive
at a settlement that is currently hosting an adventuring party. The
enforcers could react violently if any of the party are criminals, or if
any of them are rich. If the party has attempted to right any wrongs in
the settlement, the enforcers may react out of a sense of professional
jealousy, or they may just fancy trying their luck if any of the party look
like they can put up a good fight.

(Core) It was the Dwarfs who first introduced the science of engineering to the Old World. Among
them, the Engineers’ Guild is deeply respected and its works are held in high esteem, so long as it upholds
traditional methods and values. Humanity took what the Dwarfs had to offer and
ran with it, especially in regards to gunpowder and other devices suitable for use
as weapons. The Imperial School of Engineers in Altdorf is famed for its bizarre
inventions, which can be most useful if they manage to function correctly. Outside
the Empire, Tileans are particularly famed for their bold engineering ideas.

The Imperial School of Engineers
The Imperial School of Engineers, founded more than five hundred
years ago, attracts a strange breed. They are at ease only when tinkering
with hissing pistons and clanking gears within the diagram scrawled
walls of their workshops. Inventors and enthusiasts flock to the college’s
illustrious halls, but entry is admitted only to those who display the
required talent and verve. Usually, only Imperial citizens are admitted.
However, in honour of the genius Leonardo di Miragliano, who helped
found the college, the School of Engineers welcomes many of his
countrymen (Tileans have a reputation for being progressive freethinkers
– a dangerous trait in the minds of most Imperial folk). The
school also welcomes dwarf engineers shunned by their own kind for
meddling with traditional dwarf workmanship.
The School’s accomplishments include the Helblaster Volley Gun and
the Helstorm Rocket Battery. Any machine that fires with a deafening
report and results in explosive carnage is considered a success, but it is a
brave man who volunteers to crew one of these erratic contraptions.
Engineers toil sleeplessly in their workshops to develop deadlier
weapons, or to improve existing ones. The greatest puzzle is the
construction of the steam tanks, clanking iron behemoths which spit
cannonballs and crush the Emperor’s enemies beneath their wheels. The
secret of their manufacture died with their creator, Leonardo, and of his
original twelve tanks, only eight remain.
Such disorganisation is endemic among engineers. Suspicious of
plagiarism, they scribble notes in indecipherable code. Blueprints are
often lost in the explosions that frequently gut their workshops, or are
discarded when a new idea obsesses them. The pursuit to rediscover lost
inventions can be as much of a drive as the creation of new ones.
Recent Controversy
In his youth, Professor Rastus Mickelbach won esteem for inventions
such as Mickelbach’s Marvellous Flesh Masticator, and the Ludicrously
Lethal Lacerating Liquidator. In later life, Mickelbach has devoted
himself to the classroom. His lectures in the School of Engineering
attract packed audiences. However, many of his peers believe he’s
approaching dotage on account of his recent views.
In his treatise, A Machine For All Seasons, Mickelbach argues that the
School of Engineers should not just focus on military applications,
as has traditionally been the case, but on inventions of a civic value.
He proposes the development of machines such as the self-propelled
scythe-cart, the clockwork scarecrow, and the steam-powered handloom,
which he believes will revolutionise the Empire’s economy. The School’s
officials have suppressed the treatise, fearing it will provoke riots against
the college among workers enraged they might be replaced by automata.
There are rumours of college authorities planning to enforce retirement
on the professor. However, his reputation and substantial following of
idealistic students makes this difficult without causing a public rift.

The Imperial Circuit
The Empire is divided into a patchwork of regional entertainment
circuits. Each circuit is a well-travelled network of cabarets, taverns and
inns, in which the travelling entertainer and troupe can ply their trade.
In the more remote regions of the Empire, entertainment circuits tend to
mirror existing trade since that’s where the population lies. Urban centres
such as Marianburg and Nuln are large enough to support their own
internal circuits.
The great entertainers know that the backwoods circuits are where the
novice performer perfects his craft. While the bright lights of Altdorf may
beckon, only the most experienced entertainers have the chops to satisfy a
sophisticated and demanding urban audience that has “seen it all.”
Following are a few examples of regional entertainment circuits within the
Empire. Entries include a description of the major settlements, preferred
Performer skill and the predominating method of travel (river or road).
North-East Passage: The circuit following the north-east passage trade
traces the River Talebec between Wolfenburg and Bechafen, with stops in
Wurzen and Talebheim. The taciturn inhabitants of the bleak northern
lands respond favourably to Performer (Comedian), and sideshow
entertainment such as Performer (Acrobat) and Performer (Juggler).
The Old Forest Road: Turning south from Talebheim, the Old Forest
Road is one of the most travelled entertainment circuits in the Empire.
The sturdy and solemn folk of the Talebecland interior respond favourably
to Performer (Actor) and Performer (Singer), especially if their act features
woodland themes or Taal and Rhya.
Averland: The Averland circuit continues south along the Old Dwarf
Road from Wurtbad to Averheim, and on to Grenzstadt. The earthy
folk of the rolling Averland plains are famous for their love of tall of
tales, and respond favourably to Performer (Storyteller), and musical
entertainment such as Performer (Dancer), Performer (Musician) and
Performer (Singer).
Nuln: A short jog west along the River Aver leads to the City-State
of Nuln, the cultural centre of the Empire. All performance skills are
welcome in Nuln, although the wealthier and more urbane audiences
gravitate to the civilised entertainments such as Performer (Actor),and
Performer (Poet).
Adventure Seeds
An Entertaining End: Entertainers are being called to work at a large
festival in a remote town. In truth, the entertainers are being used as
bait to lure victims to a secret Chaos ritual requiring the mass harvesting
of souls.
Pressed into Service: A local witch hunter is planning to infiltrate the
court of a suspect noble in the guise of an entertainer. The witch hunter
needs training and a partner who can actually entertain.
A Blasphemous Ballad: A mysterious patron has secretly commissioned
prominent singers in the region to draft a few verses to what promises
to be an epic ballad of betrayal. The singers are unaware of each other’s
involvement or what the final ballad will be about, but rumours have
been circulating that once completed, the ballad will actually perform a
blasphemous ritual if all the verses are sung in the correct order.

These young Elves are the public face of the Merchant Houses. They negotiate the contracts, make the

Envoys spend their day dealing with humans, particularly merchants.
Each morning an envoy wakes and meditates on the coming day before
washing and dressing. He rarely breakfasts alone, instead eating with
one or more business associates and learning about new events and
problems over the food. Once the meal is done, the envoy begins the
first of his morning meetings, discussing deals in progress or arranging
new ones. The entire morning is spent in such meetings, making
arrangements for various goods to be bought and sold.
Lunch is also a time for work, and the envoy handles business while
eating and also charming his dining companions. After lunch most
envoys tour their family’s holdings, examining each warehouse and its
contents to make sure everything is in order. This is also when they
make shipping and storage arrangements, organizing schedules and
payments with the warehouse owners, dockmasters, and labourers.
Dinner is a more social meal than breakfast or lunch, though there is
still work to be done. The envoy usually dines at the home of a business
partner or prospective partner, and must be the charming elvish guest,
delighting his hosts in order to facilitate good work relations later. Deals
are often made after dinner, in the host’s study, but rarely over the table
itself.
After dinner and negotiations, the envoy can retire to his family’s home
and his own private chambers. This is the only real peace the envoy
gets, and he uses the time to consider the day’s events and organize his
thoughts about how business went and what must be done tomorrow.
Many envoys also take this time for hobbies like music, painting, or
woodcarving, activities that occupy their hands but leave their minds
free to consider their day.
Affiliations
An envoy’s strongest affiliation is to his family. Each envoy is a member
of his trading house by blood. This ensures the envoy will keep his
employer’s interests as his first priority, since that employer is his own
family.
Envoys have other associations, however. Most commodities have
an informal community around them, and members often meet to
discuss recent trends in material, craft, shipping, and sales. Because
several crafts and items overlap, a single commodity could require
several different associations, and envoys are expected to belong to each
relevant group. Thus, if the envoy’s family fashions and sells tapestries,
the envoy will be part of the tapestry-makers’ community. However,
he may also be a member of the weavers’ guild, the dyers’ guild, and
the rug merchants’ union. Thus envoys can wind up spending hours
each week attending formal meetings and informal gatherings. The
advantage is that the envoy then knows everyone else in those related
fields, and also knows all the latest news and gossip. Clever envoys join
associations which do not at first glance seem connected, but provide
valuable related information. Thus the envoy of a tapestry house might
join a ropemakers’ guild because ropes are needed to bind the tapestries,
and when rope prices go up tapestry-makers will need to raise their own
prices to absorb the additional cost.
Adventure Seeds
New Business, New Worries: The envoy is instructed to meet and
sound out a new merchant as a potential business partner. The merchant
is a newcomer, recently rich and very ambitious, but something about
him – and the source of his sudden wealth – is disquieting.

Estalian Diestro
I will parry your prima attacks on my three-quarters radial, and take zeh
high ground. With just a fifty-three inch reach, you can’t win this fight using a
cutting blade. Not with such a poor stance, senor.
(Core) The Estalian Kingdoms are southwest of the Empire. There the threat of Chaos seems remote. The
Chaos Wastes are quite distant from this sunny land, which has never witnessed the wrath of bloodthirsty
hordes the way the Empire and Kislev have. Its people engage in other pursuits, from science and scholarship
to crime and vendetta. One thing Estalians dearly love is swordplay. Its cities sport many fencing schools,
each with its own style. Many of these styles are descended from the teachings of Master Figueroa, a legendary
swordsman who applied the latest scientific theories to his swordplay with spectacular results. Followers of
the Figueroa style, known as Diestro, fight and duel across Estalia. Some, bored with their homeland, seek
excitement elsewhere, favouring Tilea and Bretonnia. The bravest travel northeast to the Empire to test their
rapiers against worthy opponents, and to see a land in the front line of the struggle against Chaos.
Note: If this is your Starting Career, you are from Estalia, but have come to the Empire to seek
adventure.

Sparring Words
Estalians are known to be talkative and vivacious people, both in love
and quarrel. Between Diestros, engaging in dialogue during combat is
expected. Non-Diestros, although not expected to reciprocate, aren’t
spared the verbal assault that accompanies a Diestro’s rapier.
Introduccione: Diestros consider it poor form to cross swords without
first introducing oneself. In a tournament, the fighter who draws steel
before exchanging formalities is disqualified. This is an appropriate time
to comment on reputations and parentage.
Metodologia: Amid the opening thrusts and parries of combat, a
Diestro explains how he will win, in technical or even mathematical
terms. Tournament discourse follows a strict code, allowing either party
to question the other’s calculations. Street fights are somewhat less
orderly, sounding more like jargon-shouting contests.
Critica: After several blows have been traded, Diestros vocally
analyse the other’s technique. Individual personalities set the tenor
of this analysis, but usually the goal is to demoralise the enemy. In
theory, tournaments enforce polite conduct, but in practice this only
encourages veiled insults and false platitudes.
Ultimos Floreo: The winner customarily salutes his fallen opponent
with a dazzling flourish. If the opponent is still alive, a verbal summary
of the fight may follow. Tournament fighters must yield the last word to
the victor.
Estevan and Casanova
If Figuera is the father of all Diestro schools, then Estevan is his bastard
son, and Casanova, an impertinent grandchild. Estevan and Casanova
are just two of the many scholars who have experimented with Figuera’s
original doctrine.
Claudius Estevan was a younger contemporary of Figuera, whose
teachings are rejected by many purists. Estevan’s school incorporates
the main gauche, requiring the fighter to shift his center of gravity
backwards by several degrees. Rather than using the off-hand for balance
as Figuera advocated, Estevan proposed it should be used for defense.
The Estevan style is less graceful and relies heavily on trigonometry. At
the GM’s discretion, Diestros may substitute the Specialist Weapon
(Parrying) Talent for Strike Mighty Blow.
Manuel Casanova died recently, after a long, successful career.
Known for his blinding foot-speed and genius in physics, Casanova
revolutionised tournament fighting with a more strategic approach.
Against weaker early round opponents, Casanova developed methods to
win quickly with minimal injury. A favourite tactic involved disarming
the enemy immediately, and snatching his weapon to force a concession.
At the GM’s discretion, Diestros may substitute the Disarm Talent for
Strike Mighty Blow.
Adventure Seeds
Revenge: The murderer of a Diestro’s father fled to the Empire years
ago. Until recently, the Diestro hunted him without any luck, but
finally the killer has been found. Revenge won’t come easily though, for
the killer leads an outlaw gang and is protected by loyal bodyguards.
A Reluctant Rescue: A local burgher’s daughter is smitten with a
dashing Estalian. When the Diestro prepares to travel onward, the
adventurous girl insists on joining him. The girl’s father doesn’t react
favourably, and organises a rescue party to recover the girl and punish
her “kidnapper.”

ExConvict
Oh yes, sir, I’m completely reformed. I’ve learned my lesson, m’lord. Honest Rickard, that’s what they’ll be
calling me from now on, strewth.
(New) The prisons of the Old World are brutal sub-realms unto themselves where only
the strong and ruthless survive. Of the few convicts who do live through
their sentences, most return to society as harder criminals than before they
entered prison. The Shallyan might preach about forgiveness and secondchances,
but the truth is that the rare ExConvict who does manage to reform is
met with the same suspicion and resentment as those who do not. In the end, most
ExConvicts are released into an unreceptive world with few opportunities other than to
commit new crimes, return to prison and begin the cycle anew.

Prisons of the Old World
Krinkleheim: The Countess Beatrice von Liebwitz von Nuln Academy
for the Salvation of Troubled Youth is more widely recognised by the
name “Krinkleheim,” after the mansion in which it is located. While
hardened criminals and heretics go to the Iron Tower, the delinquent
youth of Nuln are given a second chance at Krinkleheim. Boys and
girls live in separate wings, and follow a strict curriculum of prayer,
instruction and discipline. Escape isn’t difficult, but repeat offenders are
sent to the Iron Tower.
Leopoldheim: Situated on the western coast of the Southlands is the
Imperial Penal Colony of Leopoldheim. Twice yearly, a new shipload of
the Empire’s most hardened criminals sets off for the steaming jungle
colony. Convicts are branded with the letter “I” and the year of their
incarceration, and may not return to the Empire for the duration of
their sentence. There are no prison cells or jailers in Leopoldheim. An
Imperial garrison is stationed there not to keep prisoners in, but to keep
the hostile natives out. If the denizens of the jungle don’t finish off the
prisoners, disease will, and life in the colony is a miserable existence.
Rijker’s Isle: The fortress prison of Rijker’s Isle is one of Marienburg’s
most recognisable landmarks. The massive fortress is both a prison for
hardened criminals and a clearing house for Marienburg’s undesirables.
Most days, convicts are locked in grubby two-man cells with rotten
straw flooring that is changed annually. A company of Tilean
mercenaries man the walls with crossbows, but they are rarely employed.
Escape from the fortress is theoretically possible, but the cold water and
dangerous undercurrents of Marienburg harbour prevent all but the
most desperate attempts.
The Middenheim Mining Colony and Penitentiary: Just over a
day’s ride north from Middenheim is the infamous Mining Colony and
Penitentiary bearing the city’s name. The Middenheim Miner’s Guild
oversees the administration of the penitentiary, but the day-to-day
handling of prisoners is managed by a corps of hardened mercenaries.
Convicts can expect gruelling fourteen-hour shifts in cramped and
dangerous mines where cave-ins and tunnel collapses are a constant
threat. Only the toughest convicts will survive even the briefest stint
here.
Escaped Convict
While most prisoners are content to “do their time”, those who cannot
bear even the shortest periods of incarceration will try to escape. Escape
from an Old World prison is no simple matter, however, and the
consequences of recapture are dire.
Communication between prisons and the local road wardens ensures
that an escaped prisoner’s description will be tucked into every
messenger bag and posted on trees and message boards across the
province. The authorities will offer lucrative gold rewards for the
recapture of notorious escapees, attracting bounty hunters like flies to
manure.
Players can substitute the ExConvict career with Escaped Convict, with
the GM’s permission. Escaped Convicts receive the Escape Artist Talent
instead of Resistance to Disease, but gain a bounty on their head (the
amount is decided by the GM).
Adventure Seeds
Giving Crime a Bad Name: A pair of escaped convicts are rampaging
across the countryside killing and looting everyone and everything
in their wake. As a result, the local watchmen and road wardens are
making life impossible for honest criminals, and the lords of the
underworld are demanding a quick resolution.

Exciseman
You lost this year’s tax receipt? How unfortunate, master cobbler. Toss his home, my lads! I want every penny
found! Time to pay up, my friend.
(TiT) All cities require taxes and tariffs to function. The constant flow of money ensures public works
and servants receive the funding they need, whilst also lining the pockets of the politicians. But no
matter how good the cause or how noble the deed, no one likes to pay taxes. Since this is unpopular
reality, most lawmakers distance themselves from the collection of monies, relying on
specially hired Excisemen to do their work instead. Of all the people in the city, the
Exciseman is likely the most unpopular, right alongside the dyers, beggars, and the rest
of the rabble. Though they face hostility at every turn, most Excisemen know their duty
is a necessary one. Still, these individuals are rarely well paid for their thankless job. As a
result, few of them enjoy what they do and look for the fastest route to improve their lot, either
through skimming the coffers and double-dealing or working extra hard in the faint hope of
securing a better position in the government.
Note: If you’re rolling for your starting career, you may substitute Exciseman for Burgher with
your GM’s permission.

A Day in the Life
No one likes a tax collector. Even law abiding citizens flush with coin
rarely welcome the exciseman as he makes his rounds. His day starts
with a stern exhortation by his crew boss to let no coin go uncounted,
let no duty be dodged, and make his quota of revenue or be sent to the
poorhouse. The exciseman then has a choice: carefully and scrupulously
uphold the law, taking only what is actually due from the people
who actually owe it; or to fleece foreigners, the powerless, and the
unconnected of enough coin to make his quota and a little extra. In the
history of the Empire, it is doubtless some exciseman somewhere has
taken the first option. No one can recall exactly when, but surely it has
happened.
The luckiest and most well connected excisemen are assigned to the
gates of a community. With a constant flow of traffic and tradesman,
it is easy enough to meet quotas. Also, if things ever do turn ugly, the
city watch is right there to save the exciseman’s neck. The exciseman
who must go amongst the populace has a far harder time of it. For him
this is a rough business – shaking down strangers, combing the markets
for merchants who can’t produce a current tax receipt, and rapping on
doors in the worst quarters of town to track down tax dodgers. Unless
he wants to brave the streets alone, he must hire thugs or off-duty
watchman. Since the lawmakers and politicians are usually loath to
overtly sanction such bully squads, they often have to be paid with coin
skimmed from the till.
The Publican Union of Talabheim
This powerful brotherhood of excisemen wields no official power in city
of Talabheim. That doesn’t change the fact that his guild is one of the
most powerful and prevalent. Without the Publicans there would be
no tax revenue. Unhappy with the continuous harassment (and even
assault) of their members, this group arose to champion the friendless
tax collector.
The Publican Union’s greatest contribution to its members (who must
pay a yearly membership fee) is that they use their influence to get
watch patrols assigned to aid excisemen. This makes tax collection far
easier, as few businessmen or labourers want to take on the notoriously
vindictive Talabheim city watch.
On the few occasions where the watch wasn’t enough to discourage
attacks on their members, there have been rumours that the Publican
Union has hired criminal thugs and assassins. Whatever the truth, what
is certain is that the Publican Union is one of the most ruthless and
mercenary guilds the Empire has ever known. Any visiting adventures
had best be wary of them.
Adventure Seeds
Crossroads: An excisemen and his bully squad are desperately short of
their quota. The tax man is quick to decide that the party is delinquent
on their taxes and need to be shaken down. The party can accept this
robbery, talk their way out of it, or fight the squad and become outlaws.
The Torsten Tommel Affair: City records indicate Torsten Tommel,
allegedly a humble apothecary, hasn’t paid taxes in years. The last
exciseman sent after him met an unfortunate accident and was found
floating in the river three days later. One honest city official has decided
enough is enough and has hired outside help to find out who Torsten
Tommel really is.

Exorcist
The patient responds to the holy symbol of Ulric but not to Sigmar’s; I’ll have to study this to determine the
best course of action. I’m confident we can identify and cast out the spirit in my next visit.
(SH) Among the many dangers (natural and unnatural) facing the people of the Old World is
possession by malefic spirits. Seeking to do harm in the land of the living, these spirits take over the
bodies of their victims with the goal of wreaking as much havoc as possible. Some are nearly mindless,
sending their hosts on violent rampages ending most often in the death of all concerned. Others are
subtler in their activities, using the victim’s unwitting friends, family, and associates to help it carry out
horrifying deeds. Among the Undead, possession commonly reflects a desire to resume the life the spirit
once led, to be close again to a loved one, or to have revenge.
To battle this vile threat and, if possible, save the life and soul of the possessed victim, some cults have
assigned particular individuals to be specialists in driving the possessing spirit out. These exorcists spend
countless hours pouring over tomes of forbidden lore. They are men and women of dedication and
strong will – they have to be, for exorcism is a test of faith and will between exorcist and spirit.
Some, however, crack under the strain and break down, their licenses revoked and their careers
over. Others become corrupted by the lore they studied so assiduously and begin to serve the powers they
once fought against.

Exorcism
Casting Number: 11
Casting Time: 1d10 half actions
Ingredient: A vial of blessed water (+2)
Description: You engage in a battle of wills with a spirit possessing a mortal
body. You must remain within 2 yards (1 square) of the possessed for the
length of the casting, so the spell is most commonly used on victims that
have already been physically subdued. If the spell is cast successfully, you and
the spirit must make an Opposed Will Power Test. If you win, the spirit is
cast out and the victim recovers his wits and control of his body. If you lose,
the spirit resists your efforts and you cannot attempt to cast exorcism again
for a full 24 hours. In the case of a stalemate, the two of you remain locked
in mental combat. Neither of you can take any other actions while the
struggle continues. Make Opposed Will Power Tests on each of your turns
until one of you is victorious.
Adventure Seeds
A Child in Need: A friend’s child has been stricken. The party, upon
visiting the home, fear the young boy has been possessed. As a favour to
their friend, who is poor, they are charged with seeking out a qualified
exorcist, and standing vigil over the boy while the rites are performed
so that none come to harm. Little do they realize that Tzeentch himself
has a hand in this, and they may encounter something of the Lord of
Change in the eyes of the boy before all is said and done. The ways of
Tzeentch are unknowable, and it is likely that possession of the boy
wasn’t the end goal of his scheme.
Little Known Facts
Spending many hours poring over books and scrolls of arcane lore
and forbidden knowledge, exorcists face deadly perils every time
they engage in the practice of their chosen vocation. Threats exist
not only to life and limb, but to the exorcist’s very soul; more than a
few exorcists discover too late that the spirit WAS driven out of the
possessed soul they sought to help, but it has instead possessed the body
of very exorcist himself. The spirit for its part generally tries to stay
where it is as long as possible, but when faced with the inevitable and
uncomfortable process of removal, many spirits seek less taxing environs
to inhabit.
A Day in the Life
 A typical day for an exorcist is split between two duties: prayers and
poring over musty tomes looking for information on the best ways to
drive away possessing spirits. Preparation is the key for an exorcist, and
knowledge of the ways of demons and the undead, though dangerous
and potentially corrupting, can be the difference between success and
death – or worse. As a member of the clergy, they must also devote
a substantial part of their time to ecclesiastical pursuits, conducting
services, blessing new construction, marriages, funerals, and so forth,
along with any mundane tasks assigned to them associated with the
day-to-day operations of their particular cult. Most members of the
clergy are responsible for their personal tasks as well, such as laundering
and mending their own clothing. In important, high-profile cases,
the exorcist’s superiors will often assign a brother or sister to assist
the Exorcist by performing these tasks on their behalf that he may
concentrate more fully on defeating the supernatural entity at hand.

(Core) Explorers are afflicted by wanderlust and travel extensively across the Old World and beyond.
They channel their great need to know what lies beyond the next horizon into finding new lands and new
opportunities for trade. Explorers regularly delve into the unknown, which either turns them into canny fighters
and diplomats or makes them very short-lived. They are skilled in travelling by both land and sea. Explorers
tend to be highly capable individuals. The variety of roles they are called upon to assume forces them to
become very flexible, able to command troops or negotiate in tongues they barely understand.

The League of Merchant-Adventurers
The League of Merchant-Adventurers and Gentlemen Explorers, or
simply The League, are the preeminent organisation of explorers within
the Empire. A society of map makers, traders, and adventurers, The
League has grown to prominence and power within the Empire over the
years, due to the treasures and knowledge amassed by its members and
the interest it has attracted among the Empire’s elite.
The headquarters of The League is located in Aldorf. Its façade is lined
with ancient pillars from the deserts of Araby, obsidian plaques from
the jungles of Lustria, and exquisitely carved statues of strange and
wondrous beasts from across the known world. Inside, the building is
no less impressive, and there are rooms filled with treasures and artefacts
brought back by its members. The most impressive chamber is the map
room. Over a hundred yards in length, its walls are covered in maps of
every conceivable location, trade route, and continent. The true treasure
of the chamber, however, is its arched ceiling. It bears a huge painting
of the known world stretching from wall to wall, detailing locations
known only to The League.
The League attracts all kinds of explorers, from unscrupulous private
individuals seeking personal fame and fortune to altruistic wanderers
desiring to expand the influence of the Empire. And while The League
does not discriminate based on an explorers’ motives, they do maintain
a strict membership policy. First and foremost, a new member can only
be admitted on the recommendation of an existing member. Then
there is the not inconsiderable annual fee of 100 gold crowns. The most
difficult task is the requirement that The League’s members add at least
one new location to their grand map every year, which must be verified
by at least three other members.
Notable Figures
The current president of The League is Faustus Coperium, a famed
explorer and fearless adventurer trained by the equally famous Estalian
explorer El-dora. A tall dashing man in his later years, Faustus has
travelled much of the known world, personally mapping such places as
the fabled Valley of Clouds and the Shrieking Pits of Ka-dar. Despite
his fame and prowess, however, no one has seen Faustus for several
years. Though this is not uncommon among explorers, who may
disappear for years at a time on their travels, it has presented the League
with something of a problem. The charter states that only the existing
president can name his successor. This has led to talk within the halls of
the League of a new expedition – finding Faustus.

Faceless
Honour among thieves? We are not thieves. We have no such constraints.
(KotG) All bands of Herrimaults have a leader; if a group gathers by chance, either a leader arises or the
group fragments once more. Successful bands of Herrimaults are almost always led by a Faceless, an
individual highly experienced in the pursuit of right and justice by unconventional means.
Faceless, unlike conventional Outlaw Chiefs, rarely have to worry about being stabbed in the back
by their own followers. Similarly, most encourage potential Faceless in their band to develop and
then establish their own group. Ethics have their advantages. On the other hand, they have to
keep their band fed, find shelter, and right wrongs, all without stepping over the ethical lines that
they set for themselves. Eventually, some find the pressure too great.
Most Faceless cultivate an air of mystery, wearing a deep hood to hide their features. Some are
rumoured to be powerful nobles, even Grail Knights, righting wrongs they cannot publicly
acknowledge.

A Day in the Life
Most commoners believe the faceless and their men are mere bandits,
lurking within forests and springing out to attack anyone who ventures
too close to their hidden base. This is completely inaccurate, however.
Faceless are men of principle and discipline, and hold their followers to
the same standard. They are very careful about their victims, and spend
much of their time preparing for each attack.
Each morning, after breaking fast with his men, a faceless scouts his
surroundings, making sure his camp is safe from detection. Then he
ventures into the nearest town or village to seek the latest news. He goes
in disguise, of course, though for a faceless this usually means removing
his concealing cloak and wearing a normal labourer or farmhand’s
clothes. After listening to local gossip, the faceless seeks out his next
intended victim, watching the man from a distance to study his habits,
his defences, and his method of carrying his ill-gotten wealth.
The faceless returns to his band in time for the noon meal, bringing
fresh supplies with him. He gives his men orders, tasking several with
patrolling the area, others with common tasks like washing clothes and
repairing weapons, and others he directs to scout out paths for their
next ambush. Then he returns to his study of the next victim, often
tracing the path he expects the man to take through the forest so he can
determine the best place for the attack. By nightfall the faceless is back
with his band, making sure there is enough food for the evening meal,
checking again to be sure their camp is secure and well-hidden, and
resolving any disputes that occurred during the day.
Notable Figures
The Hooded Blade is known and feared throughout the forests of
Bretonnia. Many say he is not human at all, but some sort of dread
wraith, a powerful spirit charged with a fearsome task and unable to rest
until it has been discharged. Those who have seen the Hooded Blade are
usually too terrified to describe him or even to speak of the encounter
except in quick whispers. What is known, however, is that the Hooded
Blade is tall and thin, and shrouded in a long, deep crimson cloak with
a hood that completely conceals his features – some claim his eyes
glow within the hood’s depths, but others say they have seen no such
supernatural mark. The Hooded Blade wields a hand-and-a-half sword,
gleaming, and unadorned. Supposedly he does not use a scabbard,

long weapon could not be concealed beneath the garment. The Hooded
Blade has a small, dedicated band of followers, and their victims are
always corrupt lords who mistreat their slaves, servants, and serfs. No
one knows what the Hooded Blade does with the money he steals from
such men, though rumours claim many villages have found abandoned
wagons full of food and other goods sitting in the town square at dawn.

The Missing Man: One of the faceless’s followers has disappeared. It’s
possible the man decided to quit this life of banditry, but unlikely. But
he was last seen in their camp, so if he suffered an ill fate how did his
assailant get into and out of their hideout unseen?
Due Diligence: The faceless hears of a promising potential target, a
rich noble who treats his people like dirt and robs them blind to keep
himself fat. But the faceless needs more information, which means
disguising himself and going to spy on the noble.

Farmer
Burn the cities, but leave the farms, and the cities will grow from the ashes. But burn the
farms, and grass will grow through the cobbles on every city street.
(New) The old feudal order of the Empire is no longer what it once was, and a new
enterprising class is bridging the gap between peasant and noble. In cities, burghers have
begun to appear. Their equivalent in the countryside is an emerging class of landed gentry.
Land is often parcelled out to commoners as a reward for military service, or merchants invest
their wealth by purchasing the estates of impoverished nobles. Rarely, tenant peasants save
enough to buy the fields they till from their lord. Land is inherited, but no farmer’s claim yet
spans more than a couple of generations. A farmer employs many hands to work the land, but
he toils as hard as any peasant, for the wealth that hard work brings provides a significant social
standing in the rural community.

Farmers’ Rituals
The spring festival of Mitterfruhl heralds the beginning of the farming
year, when firstborn livestock are slaughtered at Taal’s altar, and
the plough is blessed by a priestess of Rhya before it tills the fields.
Throughout spring and summer, farmers work all hours, tending
their beasts and maintaining their crops. Sheep are sheared during the
month of Sommerzeit, and the wool sold at market, the swiftest team
of shearers hanging their finest fleece in the local shrine of Taal. High
summer is celebrated with rites to ensure perfect weather – too much or
too little rain over the ensuing months can ruin the crops.
With Rhya’s blessing, the yield is ready for harvest by summer’s end.
Labourers scythe the crops, their wives tying the stalks into sheaves, and
to encourage a quick harvest before the autumn rains, the reaping teams
compete for prizes of beer. Reapers are unwilling to cut the last sheaf
of a crop, believed to harbour the spirit of Rhya, and lots are drawn to
determine the cutter, who is subsequently dunked in a nearby river. The
last sheaf is crafted into a corn dolly, and kept in the farmhouse kitchen
over winter as a luck charm.
The autumn equinox, Mittherbst, is a solemn occasion involving the
sacrifice of crops and animals to sustain Taal and Rhya during their
winter’s sleep and to placate the awakening Ulric. Entire herds and
flocks are passed between great bonfires to purify them of the taint of
Chaos. The autumn fairs are the highlight of the farming year, when fat
profits can be made, though lean years can ruin an unlucky farmer.
Winter is a time of hardship for all countryfolk. The winter festival of
Mondstille is a rare time of joy when beacons are lit to guide Taal and
Rhya back to earth so that the cycle of life may begin anew.
The Raid
“I promised da on his death bed that the farm would be safe with me.
I’m sorry, da.
I’d been away for several days, taking the old bull to market in
Grenzstadt. I first saw the smoke as I rounded Copse Corner. The
farmhouse was ablaze, and I could hear screams. Cattle lay slaughtered
all ’round the ruined bodies of the farmhands. Wolves the size o’ ponies
snarled among them, each mounted by a green-skinned devil.
Taal forgive me. I hid in a dung heap and listened to the laughter o’ the
raiders as all that I loved burned. By sundown they had moved on. I
emerged, stinking, surrounded by the ashes of my life. By midnight I had
laid to rest the charred remains of my wife and sons. My daughter was
nowhere to be found. My workers and servants I buried too.
The plough leaned against the farmyard wall. I took the ploughshare and
entered the forge in the corner of the yard, the only building untouched
by fire. I took up a hammer and began to beat the metal into the form of
a sword. With each blow the path of my new life became clearer.”
–The memoirs of Lanric Bessen, Goblin-Hunter

Fence
Lad, if it ain’t worth risking yer neck over to bring to me, then it’s probably not worth my time.
(Core) The majority of Burghers and Tradesmen are willing to deal in goods of questionable legality.
Such merchandise is the stock and trade of the Fence. They are experts at liquidating stolen
goods. For a percentage of the profit, they take a thief’s bounty and move it to another
town, city, or even country where it can be more safely disposed of. Fences are experts at
evaluating the worth of any given item and therefore exactly how hot it is likely to be.
The greater the risk, the greater the cut they demand.

Measure for Measure
Fences gauge their bounty based on a wide variety of issues. Whatever
an item’s normal value, it’s potentially affected by five discreet factors:
•	 Availability can be abundant or rare, dropping or raising prices as
a result. This applies more for commonality of an item in a given
setting, not any adjustments made by customization.
•	 Demand for said items wherever the fence moves goods can be
low or rabid. Also, the more it costs for a fence to move an item
where demand is high reduces pay offs locally.
•	 Prices rise or fall by the quality and craftsmanship of any item.
•	 The uniqueness or notoriety of an item increases prices with each
identifying trait or feature, making specialized custom items (or
common things used extraordinarily – “this knife slew Baron
Kajrol!”) expensive.
•	 If an item has been owned by anyone of influence, provenance
(whether true or false) can increase prices on an item for the fence,
but rarely the seller due to the risk.
What bring a fence’s buying price down are the risks and difficulties:
•	 Reputations (of an item or its true owners) can both increase an
item’s worth and the risks in moving it.
•	 Law enforcement attentions or interests in an item raise
difficulties in moving an item quietly.
•	 The distance an item must go to get to its best resale market also
reduces what a fence may pay for it.
•	 The art of the fence exists in balancing the rewards and worth of
items against the risks of selling them. After all, one can’t receive
profits, no matter how good the items, if previous owners can
trace items back to the fence.
Karin Dellardar
Her arresting purple eyes hoodwinked many over her years, and they
proved memorable enough that this lovely dwarf had to leave Nuln
for Marienburg when too many victims caught her eye. Over six years,
Karin had fleeced nearly one in five of the major merchant houses

Her past interests in the mercantile houses and her new identity as
Karin Dellardar have merged – she poses as the purchasing and sales
agent for the Tagranden Merchant Consortium, which only exists
on forged papers and in tavern rumors in the western Empire and
Wastelands. Her partners in crime all profit in the ruse, as Karin moves

(Core) Rivers both large and small cut through the Empire. While a few are
shallow enough to ford easily, most require transport to cross safely. Ferrymen
make their living moving people and goods across the Empire’s rivers, for a fee of
course. They favour flat-bottomed barges because they have a shallow draft and plenty of
deckspace. Ferrymen in more remote areas also favour the blunderbuss. Bandits are a constant
danger and the blunderbuss provides not-so-subtle encouragement to move along. Many
Ferrymen are also extortionists of the highest order, arbitrarily changing their prices based on
the apparent wealth and desperateness of their passengers.

Affiliations
The Sons of the River are a small guild of honest ferrymen west of
Talabheim; their many ferries sporting Taal’s horns in blue on the
prow in honor of the River Father. Their vigilance prevents many
unscrupulous ferrymen on the Talabec from abusing their positions and
taking advantage of passengers or cargo-owners. They patrol the river
constantly and undercut the fares (or covertly sabotage the boats later)
of crooked ferrymen. They are at odds with the Boatsmen’s League only
due to Jens Leonhard’s apparent lack of piety toward their god.
“Otto’s Flats” is the name of one of the larger passenger ferry guilds
around Altdorf. Headed by Otto Pentzlerr, this collective of nine greedy
ferrymen limits passenger traffic between Altdorf and Kaldach. They
move people and goods across the river easily for their allies. Meanwhile,
those who don’t pay the exorbitant fees, find themselves with rotting
cargo or forced to take long routes to bypass the ferries.
Oskar Madravvin
Born under the sign of Cacklefax the Cockerel, Oskar Madravvin knows
his prosperity is just around the bend, as he has said his whole life. He
lives and operates his lone ferry on the River Aver toward the western
end of the Moot and close to Averland. Some have tried to rob Oskar
– to their regret, as he never forgets a face and has numerous friends on
both sides of the river.
Others have tried to pressure Oskar into smuggling illegal goods. The
halfling is not one to bow to pressure, however, and just hopes no one
looks closely at the river bottom where he regularly drops anchor when
mooring his ferry at night.
While Oskar makes a tidy living ferrying people or small amounts of
cargo across the river (or downriver toward Nuln), he actually makes
more money as an information broker. With his memory for faces and a
gift of disarming chatter, Oskar often gets his passengers to share more
information with him than they realize.
His friends among the local coachmen, bounty hunters, and
fieldwardens pay him handsomely for any gossip or news on the
whereabouts of certain folk or fugitives (as do the local messengers and
gossips looking for more news to barter themselves).
Adventure Seeds
They Shall Not Cross: The party find their travels slowed due to a
lack of ferries across the river. A local nobleman has taken control of the

a few ferrymen) approach the party, accusing the baron of abusing the
situation to consolidate more power. Some whisper he backs the raiders
himself.
Safe Passage: The party is hired to accompany ferrymen along a
river into the Empire’s eastern borders. The lands (and waterways) are
dangerous due to beastmen and mutant incursions (and the whispered
possibility of vampires returning to the lands). It’s the characters’ task to
flush out any dangers and make the trade routes safe again.

Fieldwarden
And stay out, unless you want the next stone to hit something more sensitive.
(Core) To outsiders the Moot looks like a safe and happy land. The extent to which that’s true is
due to the Fieldwardens. These Halflings patrol the borders of the Moot, keeping away threats and
unwanted outsiders. They are skilled skirmishers who use their intimate knowledge of the Moot
to maximum advantage. They prefer to attack from ambush, using their superior skill with
missile weapons to neutralize the size advantage of their foes. Since the Moot shares a border
with Sylvania, the Fieldwardens have particular expertise in dealing with the living dead. More
than one band of zombies has been brought down by a fusillade of slingstones from determined
Fieldwardens.

A Halfling of the People
The Fieldwarden is an esteemed figure in the halfling community.
Empire folk may fret about the constant threat of heresy and invisible
“enemies within”, but halflings are a peaceful and easygoing folk
with little concern beyond what the tavern has on the board for
supper. Halflings live uncomplicated lives with simple tastes and an
appreciation for the status quo. Chaos and disorder are to be avoided
at all costs, and Mootlanders look to their vaunted Fieldwardens to
maintain cherished continuity.
When not attached to a border patrol, a Fieldwarden’s primary
responsibility is to simply walk about the community and present a
friendly and visible presence. Other times, the Fieldwarden is called
upon to fill just about any job imaginable, from mending fences to
helping at harvest time. The Fieldwarden knows the names and faces of
every halfling family in his area, as well as the type of baked delectables
they put out with tea. It’s a great honour for a halfling household
to host a Fieldwarden to a Bakeday meal, and the wardens are often
booked for meals months in advance. These dinners sometimes evoke
friendly competitions between hosting families as they attempt to outdo
each other with increasingly elaborate menus.
The Border Patrol
When the Mootland was granted to the halflings by Emperor Ludwig
the Fat in 1010 I.C., it was the Emperor’s intention to grant his beloved
halflings a secure homeland within the borders of the Empire so they
would not require their own standing army. But Emperor Ludwig
could not foresee the rise of Vlad von Carstein and the Vampire
counts of Sylvania. While the Moot still relies heavily on the Empire
for protection, the defense of the Sylvanian border is a task now
bestowed upon the Fieldwardens. The primary areas of concern for the
Fieldwardens are the Altern Forest and the stretch of border that edges
on the Haunted Hills.
Fieldwardens are posted to the border on rotating schedules, so no
single regiment is exposed to the stressful and distasteful duty for longer
than one week a month. On their first posting to the border patrol,
novice Fieldwardens are always attached to road patrols travelling
through the Altern Forest. The Altern Forest is a particularly active front
against the undead, and greenhorn Fieldwardens are almost guaranteed
an enemy contact with a zombie at minimum. Border patrols along the
Haunted Hills are another matter entirely, and only the most battlehardened
Fieldwardens are posted there. This area is a bleak landscape
of stunted vegetation and rocky hillocks crowned by the ancient burial
mounds of long-dead barbarian tribes. The taint of Dhar stains the land,
and draws the vile practitioners of necromancy to the area like a moth
to flame.

(Core) Fishermen seek the bounty of the sea. The many villages on Nordland’s coastline are home to
countless Fishermen. These hearty souls brave the Sea of Claws in small craft, despite the constant threat
of pirates and raiders from Norsca. There are also some fishing communities inland, by lakes and
rivers, though these villages also pursue agriculture. Fishermen are an independent lot as a matter
of course. They work in small crews, and when on the water every decision is their own. This
spirited nature is one reason why dockside taverns are always unruly.

Fishing is difficult to regulate, in part because of its popularity among
casual anglers, but also due to the inaccuracy of aquatic boundaries.
Also, confiscated fish tend to spoil before they can be sold. Therefore,
fishermen are not represented by guilds in the Old World, and this
provides incentive enough for independent-minded folk to take up
the profession. The closest thing to a fisherman’s guild is a “fishing
collective” found in many Estalian towns. Its chief purpose is to match
crewmen with boats each morning, but sometimes the collective also
mediates disputes over contested waters.
Coastal fishermen are awake and dropping their nets long before the sun
rises. By afternoon, they’re enjoying a pint of ale in the tavern, having
sold their daily catch to dockside smoking houses and fishmongers.
Inland fishermen tend to work independently, or with their families. In
a typical river fishing family, the father and eldest son spend their day
on the river, the women remain at market gutting and selling the catch,
and the younger sons run back-and-forth delivering the wriggling fish.
Lake fishermen employ a mixture of coastal and river techniques.
Strange Fish of the Old World
In addition to the popular cod, salmon, carp, herring, trout and eel,
hundreds of other strange fish populate the dark waters of the Old
World. The following are a few examples:
Aaurati: An elusive fish that shimmers like gold beneath the waves.
More than one man has allegedly drowned after mistaking an Aaurati
for submerged treasure.
Augas: Has a third eye on top of its head for spotting predators.
Bromma: Flying fish, can rotate its head. Hides from predators by
diving to the bottom and stirring up clouds of silt on the riverbed.
Congère: Bretonnian eel. Incredibly powerful for its small size. Can
tear other fish apart with ease.
Gladius: Large, spear-headed fish. Can pierce the hulls of small boats if
its young are endangered.
Mulus: Delicious fish, eaten only by nobles. Becomes multicoloured
when it dies. Two-bearded Mulus is the tastiest variety.
Polypus: Large fish with strong, clawed arms. Can leap up and knock
a man from his boat. Grips its prey and gnaws voraciously until sated,
then discards the carrion.
Rhombus: Slow, obese fish with short hairs on its back. Settles into
riverbeds downstream of cities and feeds on the sewage.
Sea Scorpion: Tiny fish with a scorpion tail. Kills small fish with poison
and eats them. Stings large predators on the head to disorient them.
Tauras: Aggressive, horned fish. Mates fight to the death after
spawning.
Adventure Seeds
Something Fishy Going On: When the fish don’t bite, fishermen pay
extra tributes to Manann, Taal, or the local river god. This time it’s not
working however, and nobody understands why the gods have stopped
listening. Someone, or something, has driven the fish away.
A Strange Catch: Sometimes, fishermen recover things from the murky
depths that might have been better left unfound. Examples may include
cursed relics, incriminating evidence of forgotten crimes, or sunken
treasures that turn men against their own brothers.

Flagellant
A Day in the Life
A flagellant’s world is that of pain. Some of this pain is the self-inflicted
lashes brought on by the flagellant’s constant acts of repentance.
However, the flagellant also bears the painful burden of preaching the
message of his gods to heathens, and leading fellow defenders of the
faith into the unending war against Chaos.
When not in battle against their vile enemies, flagellants often lurk in
the shadows of the slums, searching for souls to save…or evil to punish.
However, the mad fanatics can easily find both where the sane would
find none, choosing to see only what they want to see. Many times,
flagellants walk into the most innocent situations and turn them into
blood-soaked scenes of carnage.
Flagellants also frequent the temples of the gods they worship.
Mercifully, much of this time is spent in silent prayer, as they ask their
deities for the strength to smite their enemies. However, they also seek
audience with priests and other worshippers of the temples, attempting
to gain converts to their crusade against Chaos. Though they may gain
the adoration of a few zealots, such attempts to gain followers usually
lead to suggestions as to where Chaos might be fought…far away from
the temples.
By that measure, flagellants haunt ruins, caves, and other places
where creatures of Chaos are rumoured to lair. If the taint of Chaos is
mentioned in connection to a particular place, odds are that a flagellant
patrols somewhere nearby.
Flagellants have few allies and even fewer friends. This, of course, is
their own doing – they believe that people who do not blindly follow
their causes with slavish devotion are enemies at best, and conspirators
of Chaos at the worst. Their few friends are often rogues who whisper
lies to them, seeking to twist some advantage out of their insistence on
seeing enemies everywhere.
Notable Figures
Marko von Miktar is known and feared in the city of Praag as a
merciless flagellant. Formerly a soldier of the Empire, the fierce warrior
was attacked and left for dead on the outskirts of the Kislevite city by
beasts of Chaos. Instead of perishing in the cold, though, von Miktar
received a vision from Ursun…and somehow managed to drag himself
back to the city despite the loss of an eye.
Marko von Miktar is more a force of nature than a man, and is hard not
to notice in Praag. He wears grey tattered rags, often covered in muck
from the sewers he constantly walks through in search of creatures of
Chaos. He speaks in a broken mishmash of Reikspiel and Kislevarin,
ensuring that few can understand his words. A giant wooden cudgel,
stained with the blood of his enemies, is ever-present in his hands.
Adventure Seeds
Unwelcome Attention: A warehouse burns to the ground near a
shipyard. An ominous symbol of Khorne is found drawn in the ashes in
the center of the burnt ruin. Several local ship owners tell the flagellant
about the symbol, partly hoping to destroy whatever soldiers of Chaos
may lurk nearby, and partly to keep looters away from the remains of
the warehouse.
A Bit of Trickery: A silver mine, long abandoned, is purchased
by a local merchant’s guild. Skaven are rumoured to live there. The
merchants, unable to convince the local populace to help them explore
the mine in search of skaven, begin spreading stories that a worshipper
of Chaos inhabits the tunnels, trying to trick the flagellant into doing
their dirty work.
Flagellant
There is a stench of Chaos about you, blasphemer! Perhaps my whip can free it from your flesh!
(Core) Flagellants are crazed religious fanatics who barely care if they live or die, so long as they
can strike a blow against Chaos and all that they perceive as vile before they go. They are
often remarkablly charismatic individuals who lead other broken souls, as the force of their
personality and their strong religious convictions draw others to them. Flagellants always
wield massive weapons, the better to smite their enemies, and eschew the use of armour,
feeling that their Gods will protect them until the proper time to die has come. Saner
folk tend to actively avoid their company.

Foreman
C’mon, layabouts! Yer not gettin’ paid to sit there and gather dust! Get up and get going, there’s work to be done.
(WC) Deep-throated voices echo through the crowded cities of the Old World as Foremen lead their sweating
gangs with harsh words and bawdy song. In the bustling docks, the screech of a Foreman’s whistle sends
the unemployed running from their smoky taverns, all desperate to shift backbreaking, heavy cargo
from quay to warehouse in exchange for some coin. As Foremen are often paid according to the
speed of their men’s work, they can be pitiless taskmasters, “motivating” their temporary workers
by any means possible. In contrast, Stevedore Foremen lead their long-term gangs with tangible
pride, confidently negotiating with dock owners and traders for extra work and wages as well as
actively taking part in guild matters and turf disputes. Because of this, they typically look down
upon their labourer-leading contemporaries with undisguised scorn.

The Stevedores’ Guild
Since the typical stevedore possesses neither the bureaucratic facility
nor the swagger to effectively deal with the slippery merchant class, the
guild masters of the Stevedores’ Guild are drawn almost exclusively from
the ranks of stevedore foremen. The stevedore foreman is responsible
for managing the guild’s finances and making sure the workers are taken
care of. Since the stevedores themselves have little real appreciation
of their worth, they must trust in their foremen brothers to negotiate
the best labour deal possible. Regrettably, bribery is a common charge
against a foreman who appears to live a little “too well”, while his guild
brothers toil at a cut-rate.
Hotpot and the Ogre
As head chef to the Averland Mountainguard, Tuppy Huppernitzle
faced his share of deadly incursions from the Dark Lands. But like most
other halfling folk, Tuppy placed a higher precedence on satisfying his
appetite than his safety. One Pie Week, it seemed that Tuppy’s ovens did
not burn hot enough to properly scorch a new chocolate custard tart
he was working on. When a bergsjaeger laughingly suggested that he
find one of the thermal vents that dotted the World’s Edge Mountains,
Tuppy was off.
Unfortunately, Tuppy hadn’t considered that the tantalising smell of
cooking chocolate might lure unwanted guests to his open-air kitchen.
When a group of brigands came across the mouth-watering scent of
Tuppy’s cooking, it would have been the end of the poor halfling were
it not for the interference of massive ogre called Bargash. Although
Bargash had lost an eye in a recent encounter, he made quick work of
the brigands and set about to eating Tuppy’s wares. Since Tuppy had
always believed halflings had a long history with ogrekind, Tuppy felt
that he should take a chance and thank Bargash with some freshly made
tarts. As the ogre happily gobbled tart after tart, he admitted that he
had been starving before he came across the delectable scent of Tuppy’s
cooking. The grateful halfling vowed that Bargash would never starve
again and the pair has been inseparable ever since.
Of course Tuppy’s new association meant that it was time for him
to move on from the Mountainguard, and the pair set off down the
Zhufbar road. Before long, Tuppy and Bargash found themselves in
bustling Averheim, where Tuppy’s cousin Dill owned a half-stake in a
dockside warehouse., Cousin Dill’s business was faring badly since his
ill-tempered dwarf foreman was drunk all the time and the workers
were loafing. Dill would have fired the dwarf long ago if he wasn’t so
afraid of him.
Needless to say, Dill’s predicament was an easy situation for Tuppy
and Bargash to rectify, and the grog-soaked dwarf was shown the door.
When the slack-jawed labourers saw the massive ogre eject the wobbling
dwarf at Tuppy’s orders, they quickly fell in line. Dill had found a pair
of new foremen to replace the old—although truth be told, Bargash
does the “motivating” of the workers, while Tuppy motivates Bargash
with his cooking.

Forger
An Imperial Warrant for the arrest of Magistrate Leopold? Aye, I can do that – but it will cost a pretty crown.
(SH) Forgers are the artists of the criminal world, but theirs is a calling of imitation, not original
creation. Forgers make their living by copying a work by another and passing it off as an original,
whether it is a painting of an emperor, the seal on an “official” document, or a signature on an
incriminating letter. Forgers prefer to work in relative anonymity; not only is their work a crime
often punished by mutilation, but revealing one of their creations as a fake spoils some of the
triumph felt in a successful job.
Note: The Old World Armoury includes rules for coin forgery.

Detecting Counterfeits
When the experts are baffled by a flawless counterfeit work, they often
turn to a forger to identify original from duplicate. Forged artwork
is generally the easiest to detect, since there are so few who can do it
convincingly. Also there are many components beyond the canvas that
can expose a fake work. The artist’s signature may look too fresh, the
frame may not match the period, or a label could be mistranslated.
The alternative can also be true, however, and sometimes a flawless
counterfeit can even fool the original artist.
Relic forgery is also quite easy to detect since it is so difficult to properly
simulate the aging process. Counterfeit coinage, on the other hand,
is almost impossible to detect if the forger is working with a wellcrafted
or stolen coin-die, and not skimping on the proper base metals.
Unfortunately, many of these counterfeit coins enter circulation and are
only revealed through use, when they blemish or tarnish differently than
official currency.
A forger can only detect a counterfeit if he has the required skills to craft
the forgery in the first place. Once it is determined that the detector has
the requisite trade skills, he makes an Opposed Perception Test versus
the counterfeiter’s requisite Trade Test. Trade (Artist) is required to
detect art forgeries, Trade (Calligrapher) is required to detect document
forgeries, and Trade (Smith) is required to discover coin forgery. Relic
forgery requires the widest variance of skills, from Trade (Gem Cutter)
to Trade (Stoneworker).
Art Forgery: Duplicating a work of fine art is likely the most difficult
challenge a counterfeiter will face in his career. While art forgery is
far and away the most lucrative business for a counterfeiter, the vast
majority of forgers will never complete a single passable work. There
are less than a handful of working forgers with the ability to copy a
masterpiece, since the skills required to properly duplicate a work of art
must approach that of the original artist.
Currency Forgery: Everyone needs to make money somehow, the
forger does so literally. The art of coinshaving and counterfeit minting is
by far the widest spread type of forgery in the Old World. The complete
rules for forging coins and establishing a counterfeiter’s workshop are
expanded upon on in the Old World Armoury.
Document Forgery: The art of document forgery is about the control
of information, or alternatively misinformation. Evidence can be forged
to condemn an innocent man, or turn loose a guilty one. Forged orders
can lead an enemy into an ambush, or into retreat. A forged letter of
introduction can gain the underhanded social climber admittance to
exclusive circles. Document forgery is one of the more profitable and
dangerous enterprises a forger can engage in.
Relic Forgery: Relic forgery is the creation of false antiquities for sale
to private collectors and Temples. Successful tomb robbers occasionally
find themselves hosting a bidding war between multiple parties for their
plundered goods. By colluding with a relic forger and duplicating the
artefacts, the tomb robber is able to ensure that each of his bidders goes
home a winner.

Freeholder
…an excellent trade; thank you. Say, is that thing gold? You sure have a wealthy town here; I hope those merciless
raiders from my land don’t decide to pay you a visit.
(ToC) One of the greatest rewards a Jarl may grant to his Bondsmen and loyal Peasants is land. Upon
gaining property, these men and women are accorded a special status. For those who were not warriors,
they have the same status as Bondsmen. For those who were once warriors, land is usually a gift given in
exchange for lengthy and valued service. Many Freeholders eventually become Jarls if selected by their
King. Otherwise, they gain a piece of land and a number of Thralls to work it.

Little Known Facts
In the cold lands of Norsca, community bonds are essential for survival.
Those who serve their lord faithfully and at length are rewarded with
property of their own. Freeholders are men and women who have been
rewarded for years of loyal service with land, and thralls to work it
for them. Farming land that is frozen for six months out of the year is
difficult; much of the meagre wealth produced in Norsca comes from its
timber and its mines, some of which produces amber, a rare substance
used in making handsome jewellery.
A freeholder whose land includes the entrance to a mine could become
relatively rich. Freeholders are rarely farmers or miners themselves,
preferring to get the thralls to do all the hard work. They may aspire to
be one day; the reward for faithful service to their lord.
Warriors are favoured above all others for promotion to the position of
jarl, and the majority of Norscans can wield a sword or axe with a fair
amount of proficiency. Those who cannot are relegated to the lower
class, and are disdained if not openly held in contempt.
A Day in the Life
Freeholders must spend a fair amount of time looking after their
holdings, making sure things are running smoothly, that no thralls have
escaped, and that a satisfactory level of production is maintained.
The call goes out every autumn for raiders to plunder foreign shores,
and some freeholders – those whose lands are secure and who have
family to help tend them – may answer the call and go raiding. When
war comes – which is often in these harsh lands – the majority of
able-bodied warriors are expected to rally around the king’s banner and
support him against his enemies. Those who fail to answer a summons
can expect harsh treatment when the king returns.
Affiliations
Because of their status as travellers and traders, many Norscan
freeholders have regular contact with Empire or Kislevite merchants.
Norscans sometimes hire themselves out as mercenaries, and as such
are highly respected and feared warriors. These will often have contacts
with mercenary captains, minor nobles and officers within the standing
armed forces of areas in which they serve.
Adventure Seeds
A Journey North: The adventurers are recruited to act as guards for
a trade mission to Norsca. A wealthy merchant seeks to overflow his
coffers by obtaining rare woods to use in fine furniture, and perhaps
some of the fabled Norscan amber can be had if the price is right. Many
are the dangers en route, but many more lurk around every corner once
they arrive in the north lands, including accidental insults to fierytempered
Norscan freeholders.
The Voyage Home: The adventurers come across a merchant caravan
under attack. Nearly everyone, save the Norscan trader, is dead. The
trader pleads with the adventurers to accept his offer of employment to
safely escort him and his recently acquired goods back to his ship, and
to guard him on the long voyage back to his freehold.

Friar
Fear not, my brothers and sisters. These hardships, too, shall pass. Have faith in the
gods, so they might have faith in you.
(Core) Friars are mendicants who wander the Empire teaching religious virtue by
example. Their orders date back to the time of Magnus the Pious. A Witch Hunter,
Berndt of Wurtbad, was a particular foe of the cults of Slaanesh, the Chaos God of
Sensuality and Pleasure. Berndt saw how decadence and lust lead inexorably to the
embrace of Slaanesh. After years of blood and fire, Berndt laid aside his sword and torch,
gave away his possessions, and began to walk the roads of the Empire preaching a message
of poverty, chastity, and obedience. He wore nothing but a hair shirt and lived off the charity
of the common folk. His fervent belief was that a humble life of poverty was the surest way to
fight the insidious seduction of Chaos. The Order of St. Berndt was the first mendicant order of
the Empire, though several others have sprung up since.

The Friars of St. Olga
The friars of St. Olga are well known through the southern provinces of
the Empire. These portly fellows believe that true spirituality can only
be found in the simple comforts of life, as their founder, the Lady Greta
Olga, taught.
A brewer’s daughter, Olga is said to have seen the face of Sigmar one
morning in the foam of a freshly poured ale. Taking this as a sign to
spread his word, she began a lifelong quest to do so. Friars of St. Olga
maintain the brewing tradition of their namesake, and spend much of
their time carting their wares to remote villages, bringing both the word
of Sigmar and a barrel or two of the saint’s finest.
Vows
Many friars take vows to show their devotion to the ideals of the saint
that they follow. These can take many forms, however, the four most
common are chastity, poverty, obedience, and fraternity.
Chastity – This is a common vow. The friar will renounce the ‘weakness
of the flesh’ so to be closer to his saintly ideal. In practice, of course,
many friars fall from grace, succumbing to the perils of their travels and
the constant hospitality of their hosts.
Poverty – Also common among friars is the vow of poverty, giving up
the trapping of worldly vice in order to better understand the plight of
the common man. Typically such a vow allows a friar to only own what
he wears or carries, which depends mostly on his strength and size. It is
a well know fact that the richest friars are also the fattest.
Obedience – Some friars vow obedience to their order in such a way
that they will unerringly follow the words set down by their saint. Such
absolute devotion to a saint’s teaching can create some odd behaviour.
An example of this can be found with those who follow the word of
St. Hargot, who wrote ‘look not upon the shadow of death.’ This, in
turn, has prompted his followers to rigourously avoid shadows cast by
gravestones and corpses.
Fraternity – Many friars believe all men are brothers and vow to treat
them as such. This means the friar will greet strangers warmly, offering
support and comfort regardless of race, profession, or even apparent
hostility. While a noble ideal, such a vow can be lead the friar into
danger should he try and make ‘friends’ with the wrong person.
Adventure Seeds
Saint Berndt’s Final Journey: The followers of Saint Berndt are
making a great pilgrimage from the order’s monastery near Talabheim to
the temple of Sigmar in Aldorf. It is said that they will carry with them
the bones of their saint, a priceless relic that will need protecting on this
long, dangerous journey.
A False Friar? A man posing as a friar of Saint Dalius has been accused
of bizarre crimes in several towns across the province involving the
‘marking’ of chickens and ducks. Local authorities are eager to track
him down and are offering a good reward for his capture. Who is this
man? Is he really a friar, and who is Saint Dalius?

Frogwife
Knife goes in, guts come out. Knife goes in, guts come out. Say... have you heard the news of Madam de
Verre? They say her son has ten fingers... but not five per hand...
(BotD) Frogwives are a common sight in Mousillon’s villages. They take the buckets of snails
and frogs caught by the village Swampaires (often their husbands, sons, or fathers) and gut them
long into the evening. A Frogwife is not only an expert at the gutting and cleaning of frogs and
snails, but also forms a crucial part of a village’s social structure. Frogwives tend to be relatively
knowledgeable about the surrounding world, sometimes being permitted to leave the village for
short periods of time to find useful herbs or other essentials from neighbouring villages. Some
Frogwives are experts in the use of herbs, folk medicine, or some other esoteric but useful
pursuit. It is a rare Frogwife who does not know the majority of what is going on in her village,
and Frogwives have a deserved reputation as gossips, storytellers, and the originators of many
strange superstitions. A Frogwife is almost always a woman, and it is a great shame for a man to
labour at the swamp bucket.
With your GM’s permission, when rolling your starting career you can substitute Frogwife for
Camp Follower.

A Day In The Life
The Frogwife’s day begins almost as her husband’s ends. He dumps his
day’s catch – hopefully a large one – into her bucket and turns to take
a desperately needed slumber. She then does what she must, gutting
the frogs, snails and other swamp vermin, culling the very best parts for
sale, saving just enough of what’s left to make stew or dried meats for
her family, and turning the rest into fertilizer for the small garden which
she maintains without telling the local lord.
When she has cut up enough to make it worth the trip, the frogwife
will take what she has into the nearest hamlet, to hawk it to passers by
and, more importantly, to exchange information. The market hours see
the frogwives carrying on two conversations almost simultaneously – a
constant stream of patter with potential customers, and an equally
constant stream of gossip, rumour and innuendo which carries
information from one end of Mousillon to the other.
When the day is done, she returns home. There will be, usually, an hour
or so when both she and her husband are awake and together. This is
when they will share a single meal (made with the leftovers from her
earlier work), and, sometimes, the marriage bed. Then she returns to her
sleep and he to his gathering.
Little Known Facts
A “frogwife’s garden” is a common term used to refer to any small,
productive plot which doesn’t look as if it is. Such gardens grow root
vegetables, useful herbs and other plants, but appear to the untrained
eye to be just patches of weeds and grass. Hedge wizards, wise women
and the like sometimes call on frogwives to provide them with truly
exotic and useful plants.
Because frogwives roam relatively freely outside their villages to
gather herbs and the like, they are often the most knowledgable about
surrounding lands, including places hidden or forgotten. While most
of what they may think they know is rubbish, a cunning man can learn
much if he can get a respected and elderly frogwife to discuss anything
odd she might have seen on her travels.
Adventure Seeds
How Does Your Garden Grow?: The characters need some particular
plants, grown in a particular way, which can only be found in the
swamps of Mousillon. However, wild growth will not do; only special
cuttings, cultivated by generations of frogwives, will suffice. Short of
raiding every hidden garden in the local swamp, the only way to find
the plants will be to make friends with the frogwives and find out who
is likely to have such plants. Since growing valuable plants without
paying taxes is highly illegal, the locals will be very suspicious of anyone
asking too many questions, and care and diplomacy may be needed.
The Shrine of Nurgle: It was just another tale of the swamps, a
strange idol seen during a root-gathering trip... but the statue could
mark the location of a legendary temple to the Chaos god Nurgle, that
long ago sank into the mire. Both followers of Nurgle and enemies of
Chaos have an interest in this temple and its secrets, but the locals are
close-mouthed about who started the rumour. Even if the person who
allegedly found it can be tracked down, is the temple real, or are people
just excited over the ramblings of an old woman who saw an oddlyshaped
rock?

Games of Chance
Taverns are a favourite haunt of the professional gambler. He might join
a game of jackstones, rolling knucklebones for a few coins, or might try
to fleece patrons at dice games such as Blackheart or Devil Eyes. Most
gamblers prefer to play for higher stakes among fellow cardsharks: Dead
Queen or the cut-throat Five Knives are popular games. Sometimes a
tavern has a cockfighting pit, or a yard reserved for bull baiting, which
attract rowdy crowds. One of the entertainments of a travelling fair
are the pugilists, whose bloody sport inspires frenzied gambling. Some
towns have fighting pits, where fortunes can be won or lost with the
thrust of a blade.
Establishments must pay a license to allow gambling on the premises,
but a renowned gambler may be invited to a clandestine game run by
the criminal fraternity. Security is high and the result of cheating is
fatal. Should the watch gatecrash the event,the participants face weeks
mouldering in gaol, but the high stakes involved prove irresistible to
seasoned gamers.
King of Gamblers
The most amount won in a game of Five Knives was after an epic
contest in the Dog’s Bark tavern, Nuln, in 2511. After weeding out the
small fry in the opening hour of the game, the remaining players were
Milo Speer, a gambler from Bogenhafen, Baron Ranulf von Bildeburger,
Kleber Blume, a merchant from Averland, and Captain Antonio
Cimino, a Tilean mercenary officer. A mound of gold and jeweller had
piled between them on the table.
Speer opened with a pair of Towers, an excellent hand. Captain Cimino
followed suit with an admirable run of Knights, but the Baron flunked
out with a Troll. Blume played three Emperors, claiming victory. As
Speer threw down his cards in disgust, Captain Cimino drew his pistol
and shot the merchant. Before the shocked onlookers, he calmly drew
another Emperor from the dead man’s sleeve.
As the cheat’s body was disposed of, the game continued. Speer and the
Captain attacked, parried and feinted. The kitty grew. After two hours,
bootless and bare-chested, their ears and fingers denuded of rings,
Speer reluctantly placed his dead father’s pocket watch in the centre
of the table. The Captain surrendered his regimental badge. A final
hand was played. The crowd gasped as the Tilean delivered four Skulls:
Morr’s Blessing. Only a hand of Khaine, five Knives, could trump that.
When Speer revealed his hand, the Captain stood, saluted and marched
smartly out of the inn. A single pistol shot followed his departure.
Speer’s winnings included over a thousand Crowns, innumerable
heirlooms, the title deeds to the Bilderburger family mansion and
captaincy of the Flashing Blades, Cimino’s mercenary regiment. From
itinerant gambler, Speer became a renowned officer, and years later
was decorated by the Emperor for his regiment’s efforts at the Siege of
Middenheim. Milo Speer is regarded by gamblers as a living legend, the
embodiment of their dreams.

Ghost Strider
Little Known Facts
Ghost striders often make their own bows, hewing them from the
branches of ancient trees. On occasion, they weave gold bands and bone
fragments into the wood of their bows. The elfbow of a ghost strider is
considered to be an extension of the warrior’s very being, and each is
distinct and unique to the strider who strings it.
Ghost striders are adept at living in treetops, and often build makeshift
shelters high above the ground in the strong branches of mighty oaks.
These shelters resemble large and messy birds’ nests. Though they appear
strange, they offer the ghost striders both concealment and a place
to survey the forest for unwanted intruders. Many ghost striders also
decorate their cloaks with the leaves of the tree in which they live.
Although known for their solitary nature, ghost striders have been
known to befriend extremely unlikely allies – dwarven troll slayers.
Though ghost striders do not care for the troll slayers’ brutal tactics
in battle, they feel a kinship towards the dwarves’ single-minded
dedication to destroying evil. When a ghost strider and a troll slayer
cross paths, they may team up for a brief while, until the foes they seek
individually lead them apart once more.
When ghost striders defeat an enemy in battle, they make a small cut in
their forearms to commemorate the victory. Veteran ghost striders often
only have to bare their heavily-scarred arms into order to drive away
cowardly opponents.
Some human nobles have attempted to make ghost striders the wardens
of their forests, in order to protect the woodlands from evil. Such
appointments – when accepted – have virtually always ended in disaster,
as what the nobles and the ghost striders believe to be evil are entirely
different things.
Notable Figures
Celanoth the Blade is perhaps the most infamous ghost strider to
inhabit the Forest of Loren. Originally apprenticed to a wizard, his
renowned skill with the bow first became evident when he and his
master were ambushed by a group of orc brigands. Celanoth’s arrows
quickly felled all their foes. Some say that Celanoth still indeed possesses
a talent for magic…it just manifests in his bow.
Celanoth shuns most inhabited places, preferring the solitude of
the woods. However, the elven warrior almost always has company.
Wherever the ghost strider goes, a small cadre of foxes is certain to
follow, and even wolves are known to occasionally join his company.
Celanoth’s is well-known for his ruby-tipped arrows. Early in his career,
the ghost strider shattered a ruby amulet worn by a Chaos wizard. He
took the shards of the ruby and placed them in the tips of his finest
arrows, which he saves for foes he deems worthy of honor.
Adventure Seeds
The Tained Tree: In the heart of a nearby forest, a giant tree turns
black and begins to grow even larger. Its ebon branches and roots cause
all it touches to wither and die. The ghost strider heads deep into the
forest to learn why this tree has turned into a malevolent force of Chaos.
Missing Children: Children have been disappearing from a village
located at the edge of a forest. The villagers find traces of the kidnapper’s
trail leading deep into the woods…but cannot find any sign of the
children. Desperate for assistance, they ask the ghost strider to follow
the trail and learn where the missing children have been taken...and to
slay the kidnapper, if possible.
Ghost Strider
Those who threaten the sanctity of the woods shall feel the forest’s fury with each arrow.
(Core) Nearly supernaturally silent and fleet of foot, Ghost Striders roam over the Old World seeking
out the forces of Chaos and various other threats to the natural world. They are most at home in the
forest, though they can readily pass unseen over mountains and other terrain
if need be. Ghost Striders are deadly archers, famed for never missing their
targets. They are usually either softspoken or taciturn and considered to be
both odd and intimidating, even by their own people. They are often more
comfortable with the natural world than they are around other sentient beings.

Giant Slayer
Affiliations
Whilst slayers are treated with cautious respect by other dwarfs they
are also treated as outsiders. Dwarfs usually give slayers a wide berth,
and can even treat them suspiciously – after all, what did they do to
dishonour themselves? However, the Dwarfs of Karak Kadrin welcome
Slayers, saving a place for them beside the hearth and plying them with
pints of Bugman’s. The Shrine of Grimnir is here, founded by Baragor,
the first of the Slayer Kings. Baragor’s descendant, Ungrim Ironfist, rules
Karak Kadrin. He has not only inherited his forefathers’ throne, but the
Slayer Oath as well. As a result, he is torn between two conflicting vows,
a Slayer must seek a worthy doom, but a king must protect his people.
Slayers often stop at Karak Kadrin during their wanderings, to pay their
respects at the Shrine of Grimnir and enjoy the company of dwarfs who
understand them.
Adventure Seeds
A Great Threat: The inhabitants of Richtenhoff live in fear of a
Manticore that is often seen gliding above. Giant slayers always have
an ear out for news of such monsters, for to fall in combat against

Richtenhoff and the Manticore is merely his illusion. The spell distresses
the villagers, but spares them the depredations of bandits. The wizard
plans to continue his chicanery until the brigands are brought to justice.
Defending the Homeland: News reaches a Slayer that Karak Kadrin is

others, however, who are just too ferocious to readily die. These rare few become Giant
Slayers: obsessed Dwarfs who have found that not even Trolls could offer a sufficient
enough challenge to give them the glorious ending they crave. They continue to seek out
combat and a proper death wherever they go, many of them becoming morose drinkers
when they aren’t in the midst of battle. Giant Slayers continue to sport the spiky orange
Slayer crest, but they tend to be covered with far more tattoos.

commit all manner of valourous deeds without finding a giant
to test his mettle against. It seems unfair to prevent a Troll
Slayer from advancing into the Giant Slayer career because he
hasn’t had the opportunity to fulfil a particular criterion.
However, it does seem apt to prevent a Slayer from
progressing along his path until he performs an act of physical
prowess which rids the world of an enemy of the Dwarfs. The
Slayer path is wrapped up in shame, honour and self-sacrifice,
and any Dwarf who does not pursue his oath may well wallow
in despondent stagnation. In order to move on the Troll Slayer
in question must rid the Old World of some sort of menace
to the Dwarf race by besting it in combat. This could be a
warren of Skaven, a Vampire, a Chaos Cult or anything that
presents a challenge equivalent to slaying a giant.
Whether any particular feat counts is left up to the GM,
though it must be a major accomplishment of a martial
nature. If the GM thinks the feat is worthy the Dwarf may
take up the Giant Slayer career. He will not be known as a
Giant Slayer, though might be known as a Vampire Slayer (for
example), but can use the Giant Slayer advance scheme, Skills
and Talents.

Grail Knight
Sir Berenger Vaillancourt, Knight-Avenger of
Brionne
This hermit knight owns no lands and holds no title besides his
knighthood, and yet he is a legend throughout Bretonnia and beyond.
He claimed the title of Grail knight younger than most and swore
himself to the defence of the Grail shrine where the Lady had appeared
to him.
He faithfully executed his duties for years until finally he received
a messenger who informed him that his beloved sister, Sybilla, was
dying. He took leave of his duties and rushed to her death bed. While
he was away, the shrine was desecrated by a band of thirteen bandits –
desperate men who scoured the land for gold and plunder.
When he returned, his sister finally blessed and buried, Sir Berenger was
filled with divine rage. He swore that he would hunt all the violators
down. He tracked them across the full length and breadth of the Old
World. Now he has slain all but one – their leader, the villainous
Rainouart Ducharme.
Rainouart knows he is hunted and so, in his desperation, has sworn
devotion to the ruinous power, Tzeentch, in the hope that the Lord
of Change will protect him from Sir Berenger’s wrath. Instead, he
has become a pawn in the Changer of Ways’s schemes to corrupt and
transform this great knight into a servant of darkness. Will Sir Berenger
give in to his rage and his need for revenge and become that agent?
Or will he avenge the Lady’s dishonour and rise to become one of
Bretonnia’s great heroes? Only the future can tell.
The Seven of Salles
This band of seven Grail knights all sipped from the sacred chalice the
same day after slaying the dragon Hallerung in the Fields of Salles. Thus
their fates were bound together. It is said by some that at the completion
of their great quest, the Lady of the Lake laid a new mission upon them
– a quest so important and secret that the very destiny of Bretonnia
and perhaps all the Old World hinges upon it. Since then they have
scattered all across the Old World on this mysterious quest. There are
many theories concerning what they seek, but few facts. What is certain
is that these Grail knights have been hunting down and slaying witches.
A squire heard one of them demanding from his defeated opponent
to know the location of “the Hag’s Eye”. The meaning of this cryptic
demand remains unclear.
Adventure Seeds
A Dying Man’s Request: A dying Grail knight, his body pierced by
dozens of goblin arrows, stumbles out of the forest and passes a sacred
icon to the adventurers. “To Bordeleaux…” he gasps, “before the bad
moon rises and darkness claims us all.” Then he is dead. The goblins are,
of course, close behind him.
The Vision: A Grail knight hermit has received a vision that his chapel
will soon be raided by Chaos marauders. He is alone in its defence
and knows he cannot hold off this onslaught. Who should pass by
at his moment of need but a band of adventurers. Will they aid the
knight and gain the Lady’s blessing, or will they turn away and face her
wrathful curse?
Grail Knight
The darkness is upon us! Every heart must decide, shall I forsake my kingdom, my sacred honour, the
Lady herself? No! We shall rise as one and cry ‘Back, daemons! Back to the hell that spawned you!
(KotG) Grail Knights are the flower of Bretonnian chivalry, the ideal to which all other knights
aspire, at least in theory. The King of Bretonnia is always a Grail Knight, as are a number of
the Dukes. There are also, however, many Grail Knights of lesser rank, including the hermit
knights who spend their lives tending Grail Chapels.
Those who have drunk from the Grail are transformed. Their dedication to the
ideals of chivalry becomes absolute, and most shine with a Fay light. This light
fades over a few days after the knight drinks from the grail, but it may brighten
once more when he is fighting particularly bravely for the Lady of the Lake.
It is not possible to enter this career unless the Lady of the Lake has appeared to you and
offered you a sip from the Grail. The Lady only appears to true sons of Bretonnia whom
she judges to be worthy, so foreigners, women, and peasants cannot enter this career.

Grail Pilgrim
I am but a simple man. To serve this most holy quest is reward enough for me.
(KotG) Grail Pilgrims are peasants devoted to the Lady of the Lake, as represented by her Grail
Knights. They believe that Grail Knights are paragons of courage, justice, and courtesy, and that the
best way they, as lowly peasants, can serve the Lady is to serve a Grail Knight.
To this end, they choose a Grail Knight and follow him around. If the knight drops anything (broken
spoons, old buttons, and so on), they seize them and treasure them as relics, a means of contact with the
holy. If the Grail Knight needs anything, they get it for him. And if the Grail Knight is in danger, they
try to fight for him. Most Grail Pilgrims do not have long lives.
If a Grail Knight dies whilst questing, his Grail Pilgrims descend on the body, stripping it of relics. Many
then turn the corpse into a Grail Reliquae, which they then carry around in place of the Knight himself.

A Day in the Life
The grail pilgrim wakes in a makeshift camp alongside his fellows. After
taking breakfast and breaking camp they follow the trail of the Grail
Knight they seek, singing chansons about his exploits as they go. The
Pilgrims stop regularly to take repast and swap anecdotes about the
knight, seeking to outdo one another with tales of his deeds or boasting
of a time when he supposedly spoke or gestured to them.
The pilgrim will gather any of the Grail Knight’s discarded effects he
comes across. He will equip himself with bits of armour, bent swords,
and broken lances. If the knight should fall during his travels the
pilgrims will make a grisly prize of the corpse, using it as the centrepiece
of a sacred reliquary. Care of this reliquary is of paramount importance
to the pilgrims and they bear it with great honour.
The pilgrim must be ready to defend himself, for he follows the Grail
Knight through wild areas of Bretonnia, where beastmen and greenskins
wait to waylay travellers. Sometimes the inhabitants of a farmstead
are unwilling to provide the pilgrim with the provisions he needs, and
violence often ensues.
Should he encounter the Grail Knight he follows the grail pilgrim will
immediately make showy obeisance. Such encounters usually result in
uncomfortable stand-offs, the Pilgrim too awed to speak and the Knight
somewhat humiliated by the presence of a low-born devotee dressed in
his cast-off gear. When the Knight sets off again there is palpable relief,
and the Pilgrim waits a while in respectful reverie before following after
his hero once more.
Affiliations
Grail pilgrims are looked on with a mixture of contempt and fear by the
normal folk of Bretonnia. The peasantry of the kingdom all agree Grail
Knights are awe-inspiring figures, and so understand how easy it might
be to idolise them in this manner. On the other hand, Grail Pilgrims
are notoriously zealous and dangerous, and have been known to raid
villages and farmsteads when foraging for supplies.
The Bretonnian nobility view them as pests in peacetime. Some dukes
may see wandering bands of pilgrims on their lands imprisoned or
killed. In times of war this attitude changes, for the fanatical pilgrim
bands make doughty fighters and their presence on a battlefield is
viewed as a boon.
Adventure Seeds
A Knight Too Many: A band of grail pilgrims is in crisis. They were
following one Grail Knight when a second crossed their path just ahead.
The pilgrims have argued about which one to follow and, after much
debate and a little bloodshed, a schism occurred that split them into
two roughly equal groups. The reliquary remains a bone of contention
however, as both groups lay claim to it. Can the two sects of pilgrims
reach a compromise or will their bickering turn violent?
Dangerous Treasure: A party containing a grail pilgrim is shadowed by
spites, diminutive but dangerous forest spirits. Unbeknownst to them
the pilgrim has a magical item amongst the mundane knick-knacks he
picked up whilst on the trail of a grail knight, a green broach that marks
the wearer out as one who is worthy of admittance to a certain area of
the enchanted wood of Athel Loren. The spites have been on the trail of
the gem, seeking to reclaim it now that its rightful bearer is dead.

Grandmaster
To lead admirable knights into honorable combat against the Chaos is a
credit to their commander. And to stand and lead such a band as you is a honored
blessing as if from the gods themselves.
(ToS) A grandmaster is a paragon of knightly virtues and the leader of one
of the knightly orders. A grandmaster is not only one of the most fearsome
warriors in the Old World, but also a legendary commander and leader
of men. There are very few grandmasters in the Old World, for even
amongst those dedicated individuals who have the skill and strength of
mind to become a Knight of the Inner Circle, few have what it takes
to reach the pinnacle of knighthood. A grandmaster is always at the
forefront of an army when it marches to war, leading his fellow knights,
and often the entire army, into battle. He is usually amongst the most trusted of
military advisors and generals, and when not engaged in warfare is often charged
with planning for it. A grandmaster of a templar order is often a leading personality
within a religious cult as well, commanding total loyalty from its warriors.

Order of the Black Lynx
The Black Lynx Knights are an elite knightly order stationed within
Black Fire Pass. Members wrap a gold armband with a black lynx paw
print around their right arms as the group’s emblem.
In 2504, nine out of 400 noble knights survived the Cleansing of
Sorrol’s Canyon, unlike 3000 orcs. Count Marius Leitdorf of Averland
commissioned an order to honour the nine survivors and appointed
Sir Otto Guntallan the first grandmaster of the order. They became the
Knights Black Lynx, choosing their name from the mysterious jet-furred
mountain cat. The order grew fast in status and held nearly 400 nobles
at its height.
Averlanders consider the Knights Black Lynx the elite of the elite
among the Mountain Guard. Unlike many orders, the Knights Black
Lynx rarely battle from horseback (though they can and do ride). They
pride themselves on moving silently and swiftly, like their namesake, to
take enemies unaware. Officers are either knights of the inner circle or
noble-born scouts, hunters, or stealthy folk. Their primary weapons are
two-handed, and the majority prefers halberds, though all know a closequarters
weapon as well.
Dieter von Nachttorin, the Baron Holmruk
Born with his mother’s blazing red hair and his father’s piercing grey
eyes, Dieter has always been a striking sight. The sole heir of the
Holmruk barony (between the Upper Reik and Grenzstadt), Dieter’s
fate has always been near the World’s Edge Mountains. While more of
Averland’s wealth comes from horses and crops, Holmruk lands provide
iron mines and weapon smithies.
Dieter squired for his uncle, the Earl Felix von Nachttorin whose
demesne included two other baronies beyond Holmruk. The squire
quickly became a proud knight and a master of the lance and sword.
The earl assigned Dieter to the Knights Black Lynx sixteen years ago.
Since then, Dieter has spent only thirty days outside of the mountains
or Black Fire Pass. While Dieter is technically the rightful Baron
Holmruk since his father’s death in 2515, his cousin Karl serves as
Holmruk’s regent at Earl Felix’s insistence.
Sir Dieter became a stalwart Black Lynx. He gained a ruthless
reputation for his prowess in battle against orc and goblin war parties.
Sir Dieter ascended to the grandmaster’s position during the Averland
orc invasions of Imperial Year 2520. Sir Dieter succeeded Sir Gustav
Kelnheil, who died when orcs twelve times their number overwhelmed
his patrol at the Battle of the Parlak Gorge. Sir Dieter organised a
retreat and slowed the orcs until other Mountain Guard troops came
to the survivors’ aid. His stand on Tharln’s Gap – holding the bridge
alone with only a lance and sword against two score orcs until bowmen
allowed his own retreat – became legendary.
While hardly a young man, Sir Dieter remains militarily fit and leads a
patrol at least twice a month. Otherwise, he works tirelessly to rebuild
the order and seeks capable and honourable nobles for his troops.

Grave Robber
Can’t be doin’ with this burnin’ at the stake. Takin’ away honest folks’ work, that’s what it is.
(Core) Grave Robbers make their living among the dead. Both medical and magical professions create
a constant demand for fresh corpses, some for study, others for more sinister purposes. Obtaining such
corpses legally is quite difficult, so Physicians and Wizards both have come to rely on Grave Robbers. It is a
loathsome profession, but a profitable one. The freshest corpses can command exorbitant prices. The risks
of this line of work are substantial. Watchmen, Priests of Morr (the God of Death), and Witch Hunters all
keep careful watch of graveyards and punish interlopers harshly.

A Day In The Life
A grave robber’s day starts as evening falls, when he sets off for a
graveyard. If he were seen near a graveyard immediately after every new
burial it would be suspicious, so most grave robbers patronise several
graveyards. In large cities, where there are burials every day, this is easier,
but in smaller towns it can be difficult to maintain a steady supply
without trying to exhume every new corpse. In those cases, smart grave
robbers create reasons for being in the area, such as patronising a tavern
or brothel near the cemetery.
Getting in and digging the corpse up is often the easy part. Only fresh
corpses are useful, so the ground is still disturbed, making digging easy
and relatively quiet. In addition, a dark graveyard provides many places
to hide, and it is not easy to tell whether a fresh grave is more disturbed
than it was earlier. Getting out of the graveyard with a dead body, and
then getting the dead body to the customer without raising suspicions,
is often much harder.
Most grave robbers find customers through introductions from existing
patrons, and maintain a policy of not asking what the bodies are for.
Most justify this by believing that, if the bodies are already dead, they
are beyond suffering. Very few grave robbers would knowingly supply
a necromancer, and learning that they have unwittingly done so was
the event that pushed many out of the career. Sometimes this is after
dealing with the zombies.
Theophilus von Dortmau
Theophilus is a physician in Altdorf renowned for his skill at surgery
and his deep knowledge of anatomy. In recent years, he has taken to
obtaining his own corpses, after becoming dissatisfied with the quality
of the ones he could purchase. As a result of his nocturnal activities he
has lost weight and put on muscle, and become far more familiar with
how the poor of Altdorf live.
He has started developing radical opinions, and has quite shocked
a couple of his wealthy clients with off-hand remarks about the
oppression of the poor. He has even started to have doubts about his
wealthy lifestyle, and wonders whether he should treat poor people free
of charge.
Adventure Seeds
The Note: The grave robber finds new excavation in a largely
abandoned, and thus lightly-guarded, graveyard. The corpse is fully
dressed, very fresh, and shows no obvious signs of injury; by far the
most valuable kind. New burials continue every few nights, giving the
grave robber a good source of income. And then one night, the corpse
is clutching an envelope, addressed to the grave robber by name. Should
he find someone to read the enclosed letter for him?
From Beyond the Grave: A notoriously greedy and ruthless merchant
dies and is buried. The grave robber goes to dig up his corpse, but finds
that the coffin contains a straw doll, weighted with bricks and scented
with pig’s flesh. Soon afterwards, someone starts attacking the people
who had been in competition with the merchant. Rumour blames the
merchant’s ghost, but the grave robber knows that is unlikely.

Grave Warden
Morr hisself couldn’t slip past me to disturb these graves. Not on my watch.
(NDM) In the Old World, the grave warden’s responsibilities are heavy. He not only has to bury the
dead six feet deep in the cold, hard ground but also guard against those who would disturb their
rest, be they rats, bone pickers, grave robbers, or worse. In small towns and rural areas, a grave
warden cannot rely on the town militia or Morr’s Black Guard to keep away the restless
dead and hungry Ghouls. Meanwhile, few value his company, for he carries the
stench of death and sodden mud wherever he goes. It is a lonely life, but many
grave wardens come to prefer the company of the dead to that of the living.

Little Know Facts
They say that no one truly knows the secrets of the grave like a grave
warden. Sometimes referred to as Morr’s Gardeners, these dour men and
women are the few living souls who spend any amount of time within
the rusted gates and crumbling walls of the Empire’s graveyards. Usually
solitarily souls, some grave wardens fall into the practise of only talking
to the dead and find it difficult to hold normal conversations.
Often, when asked questions, a warden will stare blankly at the person,
not because he is slow-witted or deaf, but because it takes him a
moment to remember that other people can actually talk. This is far
from the hardest part of interacting with a warden, however, as they
tend to only want to talk about death and see the trials and troubles
of life as pale by comparison to Morr’s ever looming shadow. It is little
wonder that few people bother more than a simple nod before heading
on their way.
The dead within the Old World do not rest easy, and there is a great fear
among relatives of the freshly deceased that they will have to endure the
return of their loved ones. For this reason, on the first night that a body
is put in the ground, a grave warden is often asked to perform Morr’s
vigil. For a small fee, the warden will spend the night with the newly
dead, talking to them, comforting them and, most importantly, making
sure they don’t get back up.
Notable Figures
One of the most well-known grave wardens in the Empire is Old
Grouse, who tends the great Altdorf cemetery. An ancient and wizened
man, Grouse is so old that few alive can remember a time when he was
not the senior grave warden in Altdorf.
Silent and cold-eyed, Grouse directs a veritable army of lesser wardens,
so large is the cemetery, though he never speaks to any of them, using
instead gestures, glares and swats of his great gnarled hands to get things
done. Old Grouse has a grim welcome for those who dare trespass into
his domain.
He firmly believes that anyone entering Morr’s Garden uninvited
must surely be courting an audience with the god of death himself. To
that end, Grouse always keeps a few fresh graves ready for unexpected
company. There is also a persistent rumour that over the decades
Grouse has hidden a great treasure in grave goods somewhere in the
cemetery, known as Morr’s bounty. However, the rumour also claims
that those who come to seek the bounty inevitably end up having their
possessions added to it.

An Unmarked Grave: There is a vast cemetery on the edge of the Dead
Wood, perhaps a remnant from a time before the city of Mordheim

priceless sword are laid to rest somewhere within its bounds in an
unmarked grave. Of course, there are also tales of an unearthly grave
warden standing vigil against any who would disturb the lord’s rest.
A Final Pilgrimage: A venerable priest of Morr by the name of
Heildric von Geus is looking to make a final pilgrimage that will
take him through the great graveyards of the Empire. Such a journey
is fraught with peril, however, not least of which is that some of the
graveyards have become havens for the restless dead and thieves. If he is
to have any hope of success, he will need help from those knowledgeable
about such places.

Guild Master
For the next general meeting, I’d like Zigmund and Greta to jointly present a seminar on realising productivity
targets through actionable cost-containment initiatives. Oh, and guild fees are due on 23 Jahrdrung.
(Core) Guild Masters are some of the most influential people in the Old World, quietly dictating
how commerce is to work in various areas and facilitating the flow of trade. Among their ranks
are master Merchants and calculating thieves, all of whom play a subtle game with the Nobles
for power and control. Guild Masters are seldom great warriors, as they have many others
at their beck and call to handle such things for them. Rather they are quasi-statesmen who
deal with the Politicians of the Empire on their own terms. Depending on what guild they
control, Guild Masters may be treated with the utmost respect or grudging civility.

Common Affiliations
Crafters’ and Builders’ Guilds: Most guilds represent the interests
of their tradesmen and enforce quality standards. Guild jurisdictions
in large cities are very specific, so for example, jewellers might be
represented by two separate guilds – one for gemcutters and another for
goldsmiths.
A Guild Master typically has at least +10 Mastery in the Trade Skill of
the guild he represents. For a complete list of Trades, see Old World
Armoury pg. 93-95.
Labour Guilds: Services are more difficult to monitor than products,
and therefore a labour guild master must often use thuggery to enforce
the guild bylaws. Labour guilds may represent stevedores, teamsters,
entertainers, beggars, pilots, rivermen and sea captains.
Commerce Guilds: Commerce guilds wield a great deal of political
power and often enjoy special privileges that other guilds don’t.
Peddlars’ guilds oversee local trading, merchants’ guilds monitor trading
between towns, and moneylenders’ guilds (or banks) provide loans to
the upper class – primarily nobles.
Guild Masters typically have at least +10 Mastery in Trade (Merchant)
Skill. Academic Guilds: Academic guilds may be attached to colleges
and universities. Guild masters often require official accreditation from
a famous school like the Colleges of Magic or the Imperial College
of Engineers. Academic guilds exist for wizards, lawyers, physicians,
engineers and explorers.
Guild Law
Guild masters are the sanctioned authorities, responsible for enforcing
their guild charter. Gray areas of legal jurisdiction are elevated to
town courts, where guild masters often serve as jurors. Guild masters
may call upon the town’s watchmen if necessary, or employ thugs and
protagonists to handle uncooperative transgressors. Guild masters with
a diverse array of skills may belong to several different guilds, but few
guild masters are given judicial authority in more than one guild.
Guild Charters: Because each vocation has unique requirements, guild
charters differ significantly between guilds. Academic Knowledge (Law)
provides a conceptual understanding of guild charters, but related Trade
or Knowledge Skills are required to understand the myriad sub-clauses
found within each guild’s charter.
Guild Tongue: Characters without Secret Language (Guild Tongue)
must hire an interpreter to represent them at guild court proceedings
(see Sigmar’s Heirs, page 30). Guild Tongue represents a complex jargon
of acronyms and buzzwords spoken in the local language . Although the
fundamentals of Guild Tongue are universal across guilds, each guild has
several specialised terms that only its members can understand.

The Bothersome Burgher: A coalition of tradesmen accuses the guild
master of tampering and nepotism. Leading the upstarts is an ambitious
burgher, who’s secretly promised to reward his supporters when he

before the hearing.
A Noble’s Negotiations: The local noble informs the guild master of
her intention to overrule punitive merchants’ guild trading sanctions
that limit her tax revenue. If the guild master supports the noble, then
his own guild will become tax exempt, but the resulting guild war will
put them in conflict with the powerful merchants’ guild. The noble has
already negotiated support from several other guilds.

Hag Mother
A Bargain
The Hag walked slowly. All the adult males of the village had gathered
to meet her. She was clearly aged even for those of her ilk. The flesh
on her face was brown and folded and dry. Some said she was over one
hundred years old, and that was not hard to believe. She looked around
the circle of villagers beadily, peering up at them from her crooked
stance. Though she looked so frail, even the largest of the villagers felt
fear as her gaze passed across them.
‘Have you spoken to them?’ the ataman stepped forward and asked
hesitantly.
The hag cackled with amusement. ‘I have asked. I so have,’ she replied
and threw a handful of petals into the air.
The group waited expectantly but no more explanation was
forthcoming. The ataman spoke again, prompting her. ‘And what did
they say?’
The hag cackled again, but this time, bitterly. ‘They say they need a
baby.’
The ataman signalled to two men who quickly slipped away. They
returned a few moments later, one of them carrying a small bundle. The
baby was crying loudly, and in the distance they could hear her mother
screaming.
‘Take it,’ said the ataman. ‘And do what you have promised.’
The hag walked from the village, babe in arms, cackling.
Recipe for Warding off Witches
Mix one cup dried goats blood with one of mashed feathers and a whole
peeled and chopped onion. Drain the fluid of a she-wolf in labour, and
mix with a lump of finest cheese (Grubentreich is best). Take a raven’s
kidney and cut it up with a sprig of graveroot and two sprigs of parsley.
Boil up the she-wolf’s head for two days and drain the broth. Mix all
together and drain into a silver bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Leave to set.
Drink half and paint yourself from head to toe with the other half, so
no hag can curse you.
Only good for half an hour.

with the spirits, very quickly, or have to face the witch hunter.
Seize the Witch! There has been some friction in the Kislev quarter
of an Imperial city. The Imperials and the Kislevites have come to
blows. It has been decided that a witch must be the root cause of it all.
A bunch of thugs have been ordered to wade into the Kislevite quarter
and apprehend an old woman. Any old woman will do, as long as she
is Kislevite... but little do they know a real Hag Mother, displaced from
her homeland, lives there.
Hag Mother
If only you could hear what the spirits say ‘bout you. That’d wipe the smile from your face.
(RotIQ) The legendary hag mothers are very powerful hag witches, known for their powers
of divination, healing, and their influence over the Ancient Widow’s spirits. Most eke out
simple lives in rustic huts far from the communities they watch over. These hag mothers
rarely leave their haunted homes, forcing those seeking their aid to undertake arduous
journeys to reach them. However, a few hag mothers do wander Kislev, following
wherever the spirits lead them and sharing their knowledge. Although most appear
impossibly old and bent – their twisted spines creaking alarmingly at the smallest
movement – many retain their youthful vigour and can be unexpectedly spry.

Hag Witch
A Long Expected Party
Zoya moved towards the window. They had been chattering all evening,
and the noise of the spiteful bickering had gradually got closer. She
could see them. Usually they played on the ice of the brook or sat in
the line of trees that bounded the yard. But now they approached the
house, making lines in the snow with their stick-like bodies.
She knew this would happen, one day. She knew they would come, ever
since she was a young girl, ever since the first glimpse she had ever had
of them. She tried to keep it a secret, not just from the villagers, that
was easy enough, but from herself.
And now they were scratching against the shutters. Zoya steeled herself,
opened the latch and pushed the shutters against the wind. And she
could see them clearly. They danced in staccato movements upon the
sill, their black and green bodies like twigs and their teeth like ivory.
They called to her. Like the winter wind howling through bare branches,
their voices sang through her mind. ‘Do you want it?’ they demanded.
‘Do you want us?’
Zoya knew she did. All her life she had wanted this, but all her life too
she had been scared, afraid of the price she might have to pay.’
‘Yes,’ Zoya said slowly and deliberately. ‘Yes, I do.’
‘And what shall you give us?’ the voices sang.
‘Whatever you want,’ said Zoya. “Whatever you want.”
The Road
Take the road to Erengrad in the cold of the sea storm, and talk there to
sailors of a hundred distant islands.
Take the road to Bolgasgrad with the bitter frost biting at your heels, and
talk there to the hunters of the secrets of the bear.
Take the road to Praag in the deep snows of mid-winter and talk there to
the soldiers of shadows that claw at the walls.
But, do not take the road to the troll country where the earth curls and spits
and the trees are broken, and do not talk there to old women.

Troubling Dreams: A Kislevite noble puts the word out that he is
troubled by portentous dreams. He will pay handsomely to the wise
woman who can interpret them to his satisfaction. This is of course
a ruse. The noble has a daemon in his dungeon, that he’s using as a
political advisor. But it is feeling a bit lonely. He just needs someone
able to fraternise with it properly, in order to keep it sweet.
Spiteful Spirits: A wizard from Marienburg and his entourage turn up
and start to bargain with the local spirits. It is plain that this can only
lead to no good. It is up to the characters to get through to the arrogant
Wastelander that whatever he’s after, he’s better off buying it down the
market. Seeing a way to power, or simply to annoy their hag, the local
spirits then do their best to turn the wizard against the characters.
Hag Witch
Oh Great Spirits, grant me your sight, so I may see what dangers lie in my path.
(RotIQ) Few Ungol women develop magical powers without first demonstrating “the sight.”
Thus, most hag witches – women who can invoke the spirits of Kislev – were wise women
first. Their powers are said to be a blessing and a curse, for although the hags can undoubtedly
aid their local communities, the spirits demand a high price for their compliance: premature
aging. Because of this consequence, most wise women dread the possibility of the spirits
answering their call. As well as the wise women, those who suffer a great loss – such as the
death of a husband or child – may also be chosen by the Ancient Widow and gain an intimate
understanding of Kislev’s tormented spirits. Hag witches who come to power in this way often
live alone, grieving for their lost loved ones and fading youth.

Hedge Wizard
Magic? I don’t know anything about that. I’m just a simple herbalist.
(Core) Hedge Wizards are magically talented people with no formal magical training.
Using instinct, luck, and superstitious trappings, they can perform minor, specialized
spells. Though they may not always be aware of it, Hedge Wizards dally with danger
every time they use their charms and cantrips. For this reason the Witch Hunters
eagerly track and execute these unfortunate folk who all too often unconsciously invite
daemons and disaster into the world. Some Hedge Wizards take the sensible route and
join the Orders of Magic, whilst others hide their shameful secret.

Halflings and Dwarfs may not enter this career. Hedge Wizardry is dangerous and highly illegal in the Empire. If caught, you could well be executed.
Think carefully before entering this career.
A Day in the Life
Hedge wizards use charms, talismans and cantrips to survive, but the
cost to them in the end could be disastrous; they are openly sought
after and executed by witch hunters, as unlicensed magic use is highly
unlawful within the Empire, and viewed with deep suspicion and
mistrust within Kislev.
However, witch hunters are not the only ones that seek them out. In
some communities, people seek the assistance of the Wise Woman,
Crazy Old Hermit or other local eccentric who seems to have a
touch of the mystical to them. In a world filled with superstitions, a
Hedge wizard may earn a reputation of sorts, as one who can help a
community with potions, rituals, and cantrips – often minor enough to
go beneath the notice of all but the most ardent investigation.
Hedge wizards tend to make a rather poor living for themselves, trading
various, charms, cantrips, and blessings they can offer for a few coins,
some cloth or a chicken. Hedge wizards must either live a nomadic
existence, or be able to trust completely those in the hedge wizard’s area
to not convey, whether accidentally or on purpose, the existence of the
hedge wizard in the community.
More reliably, many hedge wizards disguise their true nature by
professing to be an apothecary or herbalist, claiming for example that
the benefits their poultices and potions offer come only from the right
combination of ingredients in their healing concoctions. Under such
conditions hedge wizards will never willingly admit to using magic as
part of their preparations.
Caution
A hedge wizard truly lives life on the edge of a knife; being constantly
on the run and carrying a death sentence upon one’s head makes
playing a hedge wizard character rather a difficult proposition.
Players should consider very carefully the limitations and consequences
of such a career – as should the GM – before it is allowed in a
campaign. Regardless -- and for the safety of all concerned -- the use of
magic should only be undertaken by one with training and who knows
the possible outcomes and side-effects of spell casting.

Mob Justice: The party encounters a mob ready to burn a hedge
wizard at the stake. The hedge wizard’s only crime has been using a
little magic here and there to help people. The local magistrates haven’t
enough clout to keep the mob from carrying out their own type of
justice. If the characters save the hedge wizard from execution, she will
accompany them on their travels for a while, providing assistance as she
can in gratitude for being rescued. However, a witch hunter has been
dispatched to follow up on the hedge wizard’s fate, which could prove
awkward if the characters rescue her or accepting her offer to travel
with them.
Guilty Until Proven Innocent: The characters have been hired by a
witch hunter to investigate a town rumoured to be harbouring a hedge
wizard. He has more pressing business to attend to at the moment,
but if they gather information efficiently, they will be rewarded. The
characters are clearly being offered more money if the person does turn
out to be a hedge wizard, a fact that may give them pause for thought
along the way.

Hedgecraft Apprentice
I know little of the arts of the hedge … but I am eager to learn.
(SoE) Practitioners of Hedgecraft choose apprentices carefully. Most are family of existing Hedgefolk,
but a significant minority are chosen for their natural talents, or because they are one of the Blessed
Few: those blessed by the Gods with the power to empower their Hedgecraft. The life of an apprentice
is typically a harsh one, with most existing as little more than servants to their masters, running errands,
chopping wood, mopping floors, and so forth. Eventually, the apprentice will be taught all the skills of a
Hedge Master, and will be freed to make his own way in the world.

A Day in the Life
A hedgecraft apprentice endures a harsh existence from dawn to dusk.
They perform gruelling tasks for the hedge masters who train them.
Although much of what they learn is invaluable to their journeys in
becoming a hedge master, the hedge apprentices are often treated little
better than servants, and perform many arduous, mundane tasks for
their teachers.
At daybreak, the hedgecraft apprentice cooks breakfast for his master,
and then assists him in preparing for the day’s activities. This may range
from packing for a journey to something more esoteric, like preparing
ingredients for a potion, or gathering materials for a ritual.
As the day goes on, the apprentice becomes less a servant and more
an observer, watching the master interact with others, and learning
the secrets of the master’s work. Although the apprentice may leave
his master for brief periods in order to obtain materials or to deliver a
message, the apprentice’s master will encourage him to remain as close
to him as possible, and to ask questions. Masters rarely lecture – instead,
they prefer their students to learn by watching and doing.
The apprentice gets the chance to learn by doing towards the end of
the day, as the master’s tasks are completed. At this time, the master
may demand that the apprentice creates a poultice, or mixes an elixir,
depending on the apprentice’s level of experience and what was observed
that day. The master observes the apprentice’s work, but does not
comment until the task at hand is completed.
Though their days are hard, hedgecraft apprentices have the opportunity
to learn much from their masters, provided that they pay attention to
details and listen carefully. Those that do so find themselves on the path
to success.
Rites of Passage
When a person becomes a hedgecraft apprentice, he must observe
certain initiation rites before he can be accepted into the realms of
hedgecraft. Though different regions may observe different variations of
this initiation, one main event is common to them all.
The main rite begins on a night with a full moon, preferably near the
time of solstice. At this time, the apprentice-to-be and his master head
to a large hedge, with a knife, a vial of animal blood and the silvery
leaves of the Dormantis Flower, a rare plant with extremely poisonous
berries.
Under the moonlight, the master makes a small cut in the apprentice’s
palm. He pours the animal blood into the cut, and then uses the leaves
to bandage the wound. This represents the apprentice’s commitment
to understanding the world of man, animal and plants, and how all
three weave together. Once this is completed, the master and apprentice
both repeat a solemn oath asking for the blessing of the gods, and the
apprentice promises to use the art of hedgecraft in ways that will bring
honour to the profession.
Adventure Seeds
Root of the Problem: Several villagers have fallen ill to a mysterious
disease. A hedge master sends his apprentice to a nearby cave to fetch
some rare mosses needed to make a healing elixir. When the apprentice
arrives at the caves, he discovers the mosses… as well as the creature of
Chaos that is responsible for spreading the disease.

Hedge Master
I understand you seek a potion. I can brew one for you, if you wish … but perhaps some words of
counsel might aid you as well.
(SoE) Those fully initiated into the ancient mysteries of Hedgecraft are called Hedge Masters,
although outsiders often know them as Wise Ones or Cunning Folk. Most live on the periphery
of the communities they serve, and are known for their healing skills and the potions, tonics, and
charms they sell. They lead private lives, keen to avoid those who may take offense at their trade
and beliefs, and are generally welcomed by locals for the services they provide. A select few Hedge
Masters work directly for their Hedgewise, seeking out and neutralising threats to the Hedgefolk.
This is dangerous work, for it often involves direct contact with Witch Hunters and Imperial
Magisters to better learn their movements and understand their motivations.

Little Known Facts
Hedge masters covet blood orchids, which are rare and beautiful flowers
that are found only in exotic lands. The hedge masters believe that
blood orchids have powerful magical properties, and will go to great
lengths to acquire these flowers.
Some hedge masters have covert partnerships with city merchants,
providing these merchants with their potions and healing salves. The
masters rarely want gold in return for their goods, however – rather,
they seek rare herbs in trade, or news about happenings in other parts
of the Empire.
Many of the symbols and signs used by the hedge masters and their
hedgefolk brethren are uncannily similar to the hand signs used
by rogues belonging to thieves’ guilds. Although there are enough
differences between the signs to make them mutually incomprehensible,
a hedge master can identify a thief using the signs… and vice versa.
Hedge masters are often sought by commoners whose homes are
haunted by ghosts. The hedge masters’ ability to hedgewalk allow them
to speak with ghosts, and a gifted hedge master may be able to convince
a ghost to seek peace in the realms of the dead.
Although most hedge apprentices come from hedgefolk families, a
minority are instead known as the Blessed Few, identified by the hedge
masters for their innate mystical abilities. Hedge masters can identify
the Blessed Few by instinct – noticing oddly-coloured eyes, for example,
or seeing a devil’s mark. Some say that the hedge masters brew a special
potion that can positively identify the Blessed Few without fail.
The Circle of Three
A small, elite group of hedge masters directly serve the hedgewise,
performing many clandestine tasks at their behest. This group, known
as the Circle of Three, preserves the ways of the hedgefolk using ruthless
methods. Nobody except the hedgewise know the identities of the
hedge masters in the Circle.
Most hedgefolk believe that the Circle of Three only has three hedge
masters in its ranks, but even this is unknown for sure. What is known
is that the Circle takes great care to thwart the aims of the Colleges of
Magic, and protects their brethren from the witch hunters. To meet
this aim, the members of the Circle usually take a proactive stance,
preferring to attack before being attacked, a tactic that has made
association with the Circle a crime in the Empire.
Adventure Seeds
The Ancient Oak: A woodsman has discovered a strange mystical sign
carved into the bark of an ancient oak that fell after a mighty storm. The
mystical sign was carved high on its trunk, possibly carved there decades
earlier when the tree was much smaller. A hedge master recognises the
sign as a portent of great danger. The hedge master must try to find out
who carved the sign in an attempt to discover what danger it foretells.
The Enemy of My Enemy: A witch hunter arrives in a village, in
pursuit of a daemon. He offers gold to anyone who helps him. A foolish
villager tells the witch hunter about the local hedge master, saying that
he can help with such matters. Will the witch hunter ally with the
hedge master to destroy the daemon, or is he so zealous that he will not
rest until both are destroyed?

Hedgewise
To some, our way of life is witchcraft. We merely see it as a way of better understanding both the world that can
be seen and the world that cannot.
(SoE) The Hedgewise are the oldest, most experienced Hedgefolk. They lead their brethren and
are responsible for protecting them from all ills. A Hedgewise may need to tackle a multitude of
different threats, ranging from itinerant Warrior-Priests keen to spread Sigmar’s Word at the end
of a hammer, to secretive Cults who could bring the wrath of the Witch Hunters down upon the
local community. Indeed, many Hedgewise soon learn a deep hatred of the servants of the Ruinous
Powers, for they bring unwanted attention to the Hedgefolk, and are anathema to their way of
life. Because of this, it is not uncommon to find some Hedgewise crossing the Hedge to hunt real
Witches with as much fervour, if not more, as the Magisters and the Cult of Sigmar.

A Day in the Life
The hedgewise have many concerns to address each and every day,
ensuring that each waking moment is filled with decisions. They are the
caretakers of the Hedgefolk way of life, and must strive to preserve its
heritage, as well as to defend it. They also need to continue their studies
of Hedgecraft. For the hedgewise, balancing the myriad concerns is a
difficult task … but one that must be taken on daily.
Most hedgewise begin their day by meeting with other Hedgefolk,
determining what issues or threats to the Hedgefolk need to be
addressed, or may loom on the horizon. Discussions of this sort are
often fairly long and complex, with all possible options – and their
consequences – being weighed.
When they make a decision on these matters, the hedgewise then
determine the best way to implement them. Sometimes this means
sending out a messenger – either a trained bird, or a man on horseback
– to let their brethren know what to do. Otherwise, it means sending
a hedge master to deal with any possible problems, or heading out to
handle things themselves.
Not all of a hedgewise’s activity involve protecting the Hedgefolk,
though. Each day, the hedgewise devote time to advancing the art of
Hedgecraft. This may come through study, or by experimenting with
various potions and elixirs to discover something wondrous. They
frequently collaborate with other hedgewise and hedge masters on this
work.
On certain holy days, the hedgewise are responsible for conducting
various rituals, and may offer the blessings of the gods to the hedgefolk
in mystic ceremonies. Such rituals are performed in seclusion, and
carried out in the timeless manner of their ancestors.
Notable Figures
Eirene Corvinus is a notorious member of the hedgewise. Though
outwardly an elderly, gentle soul, her firm opposition to the warriorpriests
of Sigmar has earned her the title of “The Imperial Thorn.” She
has many friends amongst the hedgefolk, but prefers to live a secretive
existence, and is seldom seen in the light of day. For this reason, she
is sometimes referred to as the Night Rose – integrating her Imperial
nickname and thorny personality with her nocturnal activities.
Eirene seeks to ferret out corruption and hypocrisy wherever she
can, particularly in defence of the ways of the hedgefolk. On several
occasions, she has accused groups of Sigmarite priests of being cultists.
Though she prefers to use information and guile as her main weapons,
she has a mastered an array of hedge spells – although she rarely displays
her power.
Most of the time, Eirene travels from village to village, quietly spreading
the truth about the hedgefolk, sewing discord amongst followers
of Sigmar, and seeking sympathisers to her cause. She also spends
considerable time seeking the Blessed Few, hoping to get them to join
the hedgefolk.

The Blessed Child: Cultists burn down a temple in a small village. A

(Core) Heralds are the voices of the nobility, dutybound to announce the arrival of their lords
and patrons, or who occasionally carry news of important events from afar. They are inevitably
skilled speakers, swift wits, and greatly educated for the times. Heralds are expected to recognize
the heraldry of hundreds of Nobles on sight, hence their namesake. They are seldom Nobles
themselves, but their position is regarded as one of the few that acts as a stepping-stone into
the ranks of the lesser nobility. Heralds pride themselves on their personal appearance, as it is a
reflection upon whichever lord they serve.

A Day in the Life
A herald may spend one day deep in tomes and scrolls, verifying the
origin of a particular coat of arms. Then the next may be at a grand
ball, announcing the guests – and woe betide him if he mispronounce a
single name!
Yet another day could be spent at a marshalling field, issuing orders and
ensuring that the right banners fly next to the right units, for a mix-up
could prove fatal on a battlefield. It is a life which demands intellect,
courage, and social grace in equal measure, and there are few well
suited to it.
A herald is expected to be a walking encyclopaedia of the nobility of
many lands, and read in a shield or banner the history of a family –
marriages, bastard children and heirs, deeds both noble and craven, and
so on. He will be on hand at many meetings and planning sessions,
giving the herald access to a tremendous amount of information that
others may find valuable.
Thus, heralds are often well treated and granted special dispensations by
their lieges. They do so to reduce the temptation to leave one master’s
service and enter another, buying their way into the retinue with a purse
of secrets.
Special Rules: The Language of Blazon
Heralds have developed a complex and precise language for describing
shield patterns and crests (otherwise known as devices). While this
is not a secret tongue, it requires considerable scholarship to master,
and most perceive it as gibberish. (In Tilea, especially, the language
has grown exceptionally baroque.) While the main function is simply
describing images, two heralds can attempt to communicate important
information to each other, while seeming to do nothing more than
discussing the symbols adopted by various nobles of the Old World.
While all heralds must know the basics of blazoning for their job, a few
have mastered the art of using it for communication.
Such heralds may take Secret Language (Blazon) as a Skill instead of
one of their other language Skills. A “conversation” in blazon relies
heavily on puns and symbolism, as the language is not intended for
communication.

Job Performance: A well respected senior herald is suddenly failing
miserably at his job. He has mangled names, misidentified banners,
delivered messages improperly, and is otherwise causing embarrassment
and hardship for his employer. His employer feels a sense of loyalty,
but is quickly losing status due to his herald’s failure. Many whisper the
man is in the grip of dementia and should be sent off to retirement, but
others suspect there is more at work.
Felling the Family Tree: A herald claims that during the course of
innocent study of genealogy, he came across a shocking secret regarding
the parentage of a prominent noble. He foolishly mentioned this to a
colleague, who passed it along to the noble in question, alerting him
that the scandal was out. Now assassins are hunting the herald, who
needs to be safely removed from the city before the information leaks
any further.

Herrimault
When noble honor doesn’t exceed the reach of a sword, our bows and blades reveal that shame. The people know our
bowshots still fall short of our honor in comparison.
(KotG) The harsh laws of Bretonnia turn many Peasants into Outlaws. The acts that many nobles
commit with impunity turn many Outlaws into avengers. The Herrimaults hold themselves above both
groups by keeping to a strict code of morality. Whilst they operate outside the laws of Bretonnia, they
do so because the laws are unjust. A Herrimault always acts rightly.
Of course, most Bretonnian nobles see no difference, and so the Herrimaults are hunted as
enthusiastically as other Outlaws. A Herrimault’s ethical obligations do bring popularity among the
peasants, and the braver souls often seek to join up. Even a few nobles, shocked by abuses they are
unable to legally prevent, have been known to take up the bow of the Herrimault.

A Day Among the Trees
Despite what tavern talk would suggest, herrimaults do not plot the
downfall of despotic nobles at all hours. As with any life, there are the
everyday aspects overlooked by those who glorify this vocation from the
outside looking in.
Herrimaults, living on the run from local law enforcers, often have
makeshift camps within many woods and copses. Home is rarely more
than a tent or lean-to, pitched daily to allow movement at a moment’s
notice. Only those far from any pursuit can afford to settle in lodgings
that are more permanent. At their most secure, the best herrimault
camps are caves in which they might live until discovered.
Foraging and hunting for food takes most of one’s day, since a
herrimault can’t go to market or risk approaching a friendly farmer for
food. Hunting and foraging adds to a herrimault’s problems, as nobles
often consider any game or wild edibles to be their property and anyone
else consuming them is guilty of poaching.
Next in importance is the maintenance of a herrimault’s weapons
and tools. This constitutes everything from cleaning and sharpening
blades to crafting new arrows. A life constantly under threat of attack
or capture increases one’s reliance upon weapons especially when such
equipment is not easily replaced.
Only after solving daily survival issues do herrimaults scheme on how
best to force an end to the abuses of power within Bretonnian society.
They know the best way to end corrupt actions is to expose said noble
(or his activities) before his peers or betters—honourable people who
can truly censure or prohibit abuses a noble visits upon vassals.
Aluthol Drurilke
The wood elves within the Loren Forests traded crafts and food for
ages through only a handful of trusted go-betweens, including Hugo
Dorshield. That changed three years ago when a new baron came to
Quenelles. The obstinate Baron Henri de Findrais insisted that elves
were a dishonourable influence on Bretonnians due to their projectile
weapons and their ability to see magic. He also made it a crime to
consort with the elves in any way.
Hugo Dorshield’s elf lover fell to the arrows of the baron’s hunting
parties, and the human abandoned his leather goods shop to take to
the trees of Loren. Hugo directs his revenge not at the hunters but the
bigger game of their liege lord. A former hunter himself, Hugo knows
to bait his prey toward a planned ambush. He has captured baronial
hunters and knows the baron’s overlord is due for deer hunting. Hugo
plans overt harassment (peppering coaches or camps with arrows from
hiding, startling horses with whistling arrows, etc.) to stoke the temper
of the Baron de Findrais and lure his party deeper into the forest.
The man knows the baron may likely expose his immoral actions and
prejudices before the eyes of greater nobility. If not, Hugo and his few
elf allies can confront his lies directly as they return his “cannibalized”
men to him and ask about the fate of their envoys sent to the baron.
Adventure Seeds
The Earl de Courcy: Travelling across Bretonnia is pleasant until
entering the Earl de Courcy’s lands. Mercenaries and bounty hunters
abound, levelling charges of witchcraft and sedition on innocent
commonfolk, forcing them into the service of the Earl lest they be
handed over to the witch hunters for trial. A band of herrimaults
decides they need to put a stop to the Earl’s strong-armed tactics once
and for all.

High Priest
Blessed be Sigmar for his many boons. He has shown us great favour this day by granting us the
strength to defeat our foes and spread his most holy word.
(Core) A High Priest is the living embodiment of his God’s will in the Old World. They
are fairly rare, as few individuals have both the strength of character and the boundless
faith it takes to reach such a lofty post. High Priests, with very few exceptions, will
operate out of one of the primary centres of their faith. Pilgrims will travel the breadth
of the Empire just to speak for a few moments with such a being. High Priests
tend to either reject the physical world, retiring to a monastery or embrace the
temporal, becoming powerful secular leaders.

gouged out his eyes, and sliced off his ears. However, it was only when
they tried to cut out his tongue that Chrysostom revealed the temple’s
real treasure.
The white flame of Verena’s truth flickered on his tongue. Chrysostom
began to talk, and though he spoke in the classical language of the
ancients, the goblins understood every word. He revealed to them the
utter worthlessness of their lives, and the universal hatred their kind
inspired. He taught the concept of shame to the shameless, and in their
self-loathing some fell on their own swords, while the rest fled to their
lairs in despair.
In time the temple was rebuilt, and the tale of the high priest’s
miraculous deliverance spread throughout the Empire. Chrysostom is
the epitomy of what a high priest should aim to become: a person of
unblemished tongue and devout heart.
Adventure Seeds
The Bone Thief: A high priest learns of a venerated soul whose bones
lie in a remote, forgotten shrine. Obviously the relics must be removed
to a more prestigious place of worship: the High Priest’s own temple.
There they will receive the veneration they deserve (and boost a flagging
congregation). No doubt its keepers will kick up an impious fuss.
The Curse: An adventuring party acquires a cursed amulet bearing the
mark of Ranald, the god of tricksters. They learn it is a long-lost cult
artefact, and the only means of removing the curse is for a high priest
of Ranald to pray for clemency. The high priest that they visit refuses to
help them until they have secured Ranald’s favour. What unscrupulous
mission will they be expected to undertake?
Pomp and Ceremony
Many folk decry the pomp of the Empire’s high priests, arguing they are
wrong to enjoy such luxury when most of their congregation can barely
scratch a living.
True, the trappings of a high priest include rich ceremonial garb (and
for especially high-ranking clergy, a grand pontifical palace) but their
apologists argue that as interceders with the gods and ambassadors of
their faith, high priests must behave with dignity befitting their station.
Sadly, it is true that some high priests do abuse their influence, glutting
themselves on luxury and employing a steward to maintain their affairs.
The lower clergy, unchecked by an indolent superior, may become lazy
in their vocation. However, this leads to vacant pews and, worse, empty
offering plates. It is not unknown for an irresolute high priest to be
hounded out of office by zealous clergy who rouse the rabble against his
impious ways. The cult authorities are quick to replace him with a more
devout candidate. Thankfully this is a rare occurence.
The Golden Tongue
On the day of Year’s Blessing, pilgrims swarm to the remote Temple
of the Silver Well to hear the honey-toned sermons of the “Golden
Tongue,” Chrysostom, High Priest of Verena. Blind and deaf, with a
flowing, snowy beard, he preaches his goddess’s holy truths from his
pulpit, his limbless torso supported by two of his most faithful minions.
Half a century ago, goblins raided the temple, murdering its priests.
The greenskins spared only Chrysostom. Pickings were meagre, useless
scrolls and musty books, and the goblins were desperate to know the
location of the temple’s gold. The fiends hacked at their captive’s limbs,

Highwayman
This won’t take long. Just hand over your jewellery. If you resist, it will all be over much quicker.
(Core) Highwaymen prey on the coaches that roam over the roads of the Old World, relieving lockboxes
of their goods and passengers of their valuables. They affect the styles of the upper nobility, wearing
elaborate masks and showing every point of etiquette to their victims, as they prefer to regard themselves as
daring rogues rather than high-class Thieves. Highwaymen, by necessity, are skilled horsemen, adept at
convincing their horses to race over uneven and treacherous ground at high speeds. They are
also excellent shots, as they have to contend not only with swiftly moving targets, but a
large number of dangerous forest denizens as well.

Affiliations
Highwaymen are a perfect example of the old adage that nothing is
as simple as it seems. Most of their victims assume highwaymen are
loners who work in complete isolation. Nothing could be further from
the truth. A skilled highwayman has several accomplices, some more
involved – and more aware of his true occupation – than others.
First and most important to any highwayman is his stablehands. A
highwayman depends on his horse for his livelihood, so the steed
must be kept completely healthy and ready to ride at any time.
Most highwaymen maintain a hidden stable somewhere. They pay
a stablemaster handsomely to live beside the stables and care for the
horse or horses at all hours – the stablemaster’s sons are pressed into
service as stableboys.
After the horse, the highwayman has to worry about his ill-gotten
gains. Coins can be used as is, but jewelry and other valuables must be
disposed of quickly and quietly. For this the highwayman requires a
good fence, or several who specialize in different items. The fence is not
a friend, but simply a business associate, one whose own best interests
are served by handling the highwayman’s loot and keeping his secrets.
Next, amusingly enough, are the highwayman’s outfitters. Highwaymen
pride themselves on their fine clothes. Therefor, they require excellent
tailors, haberdashers, and cobblers. These men and women must be able
to produce outfits of the finest quality and the latest style, but they must
also work discreetly.
Finally, most highwaymen employ townfolk as scouts to inform
them when a likely victim approaches. Often these men are simply
local tavern owners, who report on their recent customers by some
prearranged method.
Little Known Facts
A few notable highwaymen are actually noble-born.They were given
the appropriate training and education for their class but have no
family wealth to support them, either because their family has lost its
money or because they are too far down the line to inherit anything.
These penniless nobles make good highwaymen because they have the
breeding, the style, and the skills, and because they can recognize good
materials and fine gems on sight.
A highwayman’s horse is specially trained to ignore gunshots and to
move across rough terrain. Most of these steeds are easily the match of
a fast courier horse for speed and an expert warhorse for intelligence,
nerves, and combat reflexes.
Not all highwaymen are, in fact, men. The occupation can be wellsuited
for daring, resourceful women who can often turn a male victim’s
natural tendency to underestimate women against him.
Adventure Seeds
Our Saviour! The highwayman hears of a likely target, a coach
containing several wealthy merchants. But when he swoops in and
stops the coach, the coachman is almost dead and the merchants throw
themselves on the highwayman’s mercy. What happened here? And what
has the highwayman gotten himself into?
No Respect: Someone is attacking riders and coaches in the area – and
it isn’t the highwayman! Most highwaymen have an unstated code that
they do not strike within another’s territory. That means this is either
someone ignoring the rule or someone who doesn’t even know it. Either
way, the highwayman needs to find the interloper and stop him – fast!

Horned Hunter
Serve the forest, and the forest shall serve you.
(TiT) The rites of Taal demand great physical, emotional, and mental
fortitude for its practitioners. Some see the trappings of
civilization – cities, courts, and the like – as a failing in
the interpretation of Taal’s will. The Horned Hunters are
deeply zealous and shun the city. Unlike Taal’s Chosen,
the Horned Hunters give up much in the way of a
material life. They shun normal clothing and armour and
wear animal skins, loincloths, or less. Part of their initiation
into this group is to undergo extensive tattooing, covering
their chest and face. Horned Hunters prowl the woods both within
the Taalbaston and throughout Talabecland and claim allegiance only to Taal.
While they lack the fiery rhetoric of most zealots, they are still fervent in their
beliefs and believe that conversion comes from actions, rather than words.

Forest Mentors
A devotee of Taal who decides to follow the path of the horned hunter
is most often guided by a mentor, an experienced horned hunter who
suddenly appears in his life to teach him the ways of the forest, and help
ease the transition from the civilised world to an existence completely
dependent on nature.
The new horned hunter is taught how to survive alone in the woods,
and even those who pride themselves on their survival skills and
wilderness savvy are surprised at how little they actually know.
When his ward is ready, the forest mentor will leave him to embark on
the path of the horned hunter alone, returning to the shrine of Taal and
Rhya to report on the progress of his charge, or returning to his duties
elsewhere in the forest.
Those that survive the ordeal and make their back to the shrine are
officially accepted into the fraternity of Horned Hunters. Those that
do not survive also provide a valuable service – as cautionary tales to
fledgling horned hunters, and noble sacrifices to Taal.
Notable Figures
Greatest of all the horned hunters within the Taalbaston is the one
known only as the Ghost. Even among other hunters and devotees of
Taal, he is more legend than fact, and the only evidence of his passing
are the remains of his enemies, peppered with arrows.
The only thing that can be said with certainty is that the Ghost is a
hunter without peer, one truly blessed by Taal to be one with the woods.
His deeds include the slaying of orcs, goblins and beastmen as well as
other, darker creatures that wander the forests of Talabecland.
He kills from the shadows of the trees with his bow, as elusive as his
namesake; his foes never see their attacker. The Ghost has an uncanny
knack of mysteriously appearing in the right place at the right time to
challenge those that threaten the cult of Taal or desecrate the Taalbaston.
Most people say that this is proof that he is guided by Taal’s hand, but
there are some who claim that the Ghost does not actually exist, or that
if he does, he is not actually a follower of Taal at all, but a rogue wood
elf. However, most Talabeclanders prefer to believe that their forest is
under the protection of this enigmatic champion of Taal.
Adventure Seeds
Hunting the Beast: A fearsome and strange beast has been seen within
the Taalbaston. Twisted and evil, the creature is said to resemble a
fanged and tusked horse with no skin, standing eight feet from hoof to
shoulder. Surely a thing of Chaos, the horned hunters are seeking it out,
and there will be much glory for the one that claims its skull.
Trapping the Trapper: Forst, a trapper from Talabheim, has been
bragging in the local tavern of a trophy he found in the woods. It is the
skull of an especially large beastman with a single shiny black rock set
into its forehead. Word has reached the horned hunters who fear that
the black rock may be a shard of deadly warpstone. They are keen to see
the skull destroyed and to discover just where Forst found it.

Horse Archer
When you sit at my table, I am your servant. When you sleep beside my fire, I am your protector. When we
ride into battle, I owe you nothing.
(RotIQ) Ungol horse archers are expert marksmen and are celebrated as some of the finest light cavalry
in the Old World. Their skills with scimitar, spear, and horse bow are expertly honed hunting kyazak
on the Endless Steppe, a land they constantly patrol at the order of the Tzarina. Their most common
tactic is to circle their enemy and pour arrow after arrow into them. Amongst the embattled
Ungols of the Troll Country, all able-bodied individuals are required to fight, especially when
Chaos marauders attack. Thus, it is common to find women amongst rotas of northern horse
archers, a tradition southern Kislevites sometimes find difficult to accept.

Ungol Customs
Ungol women are prohibited from switching clans by way of marriage,
which means that Ungol men must often leave their stanitsas to find
eligible wives. Horse archers are especially inclined to marry women
from other clans because their patrols bring them into frequent contact
with neighbours. When a horse archer marries into another clan, his
original clan is paid a dowry for the loss of a valuable warrior.
Because horse archers hold such prominent status on the steppes, they
are accustomed to receiving warm hospitality wherever they go. This
sense of entitlement can make horse archers appear arrogant, but if
welcomed they are genuinely helpful and appreciative guests. The Ungol
codes of hospitality are taken very seriously, even in lands where they
aren’t enforced by law. Horse archers often have difficulty adapting to
non-Ungol cultures, so usually emigrants resettle to the Kislevite ghettos
of foreign cities.
Horse archers who emigrate south remain faithful to their gods Ursun,
Dazh and Tor. Those who fight alongside men of the Empire may also
pay respects to Taal or Ulric. Kislevites are generally wary of discussing
their beliefs with superstitious foreigners, for the difference between
spirits and daemons is often misunderstood. Ancestor spirits are revered
openly, however. For a culture without a written tradition, oral history
is the only means of preserving its greatest legends.
Ogulai the White Fox
One of the great heroes of Ungol folklore, Ogulai the White Fox,
occupies legendary status in several of the northernmost stanistas.
Kislevite historians have proposed conflicting estimates of the period
when Ogulai roamed the steppes on his white steed, foiling beasts and
greenskins with one clever ploy after another. The style of the oldest
cave paintings suggest that Ogulai lived during an age before Sigmar.
The most famous of Ogulai’s tales, Valley of the Sun, is retold to every
Ungol child as a fable on the dangers of complacency. In this tale,
Ogulai’s tribe finds a verdant valley along the Urskoy River and settles
at a ruined dwarf hold, despite the wise women warning that goblins
would find them. Food was abundant for many seasons and the tribe’s
horses grew fat, until one day the wise women’s prophecy came true.
Ogulai pleaded with Dazh, the god of fire and sun, to deliver his people
from the goblins, offering to sacrifice the clan’s first foal every spring
thenceforth. When the goblins poured across the river, night turned to
day and Ogulai rode past his blinded foes to slay their chieftain.
Ogulai’s tribe escaped from the valley, but to this day superstitious
Ungol clans burn the spring’s first foal on a great pyre to uphold
Ogulai’s ancient bargain. Tearful children are reminded by their parents
that a single foal is only a small price to pay for the favour of Dazh.

Seeking Favour: A horse archer has been ostracised by his clan for
offending the spirits, and now roams the world seeking to redeem
himself. Before the horse archer left his stanista, the settlement’s hag
mother told him to return with the spirits’ favour. After a futile search, a
warlock offers to help him for a small price...
Victim of Circumstance: After helping to defend the Empire against
the Storm of Chaos, a horse archer settles in the Kislevite quarter at
Talagaad, a port near the city of Talabheim. Town life requires the horse
archer to use his skills in new ways, so he joins a carnival as a stunt rider.
However, the carnival operator is running a scam, and the unsuspecting
horse archer has serious criminal allegations levied against him.

Horse Coper
Of course this horse is healthy, Sir. Weeping sores? I don’t see any… oh that; those are just flea bites; those will heal quickly. You
obviously know horses; I’ll throw in a fresh saddle blanket and saddlebags for this fine animal if you’ll buy him now. I’ve an
urgent appointment in another town….
(RotIQ) Horse copers (horse salesman) are notorious for being smarmy and dishonest. It seems every stable has a
grinning coper offering “the very best horse flesh on the market, sire,” descended from “the strongest bloodlines
of the Ostermarker Veldt, sire.” As horses are central to Kislevite life, the market is incredibly competitive,
and buyers have a hard time finding a reliable dealer, especially as most will try any underhanded trick to
ensure a sale. Some disreputable copers happily paint rotten teeth white, pass off diseased nags as “shy,” and
proudly boast infertile stallions will “sire a line o’ beauties, sire.” Indeed, the only place horse copers never
sell to is the knacker’s yards, though it is a good source for stock.
If you are rolling randomly for your starting career and are not rolling a Kislevite, you can substitute horse
coper for burgher with your GM’s permission.

A Day in the Life
Horse copers have a reputation for dishonesty, and they will certainly
take advantage of anyone they see as a mark or from “out of town.”
Regular customers will know better, and will make sure they are getting
first quality animals or they’ll take their business to someone else.
 Horse copers also know that they would lead a short life indeed if they
swindled everyone to whom they sold a horse, so they learn – sometimes
the hard way – to be selective in targeting their marks. Copers have few
friends and many enemies, and as a consequence many of them live a
semi-nomadic existence, picking up stakes and moving on as soon as
their welcome has been worn out (or possibly a little bit before!).
A crooked horse coper who is caught can expect mob justice to rule; he
and his family will be stripped of everything but the clothes on their
backs, and driven out of the village into the cold, to survive as best
they can in punishment for the coper’s misdeeds. If the coper is lucky,
he will be confronted by a chekist, and forced to pay recompense to
those he swindled.
Little Known Facts
Kislevite horse copers stand out as the most unscrupulous, conniving,
obsequious merchants ever known in the old world. Even a person
knowledgeable in the ways of horse trading needs to be careful; if
the coper plans to pack up and leave town soon, he has little to lose
by unloading a sick or unfit animal on an innocent traveller or an
unfamiliar face.
The phrase, “As good as a coper’s word” is meant to convey a lack of
honesty.
The phrase “A coper’s change” comes from the tendency of some copers
to substitute worthless metal slugs for a small fraction of the coins in
a handful of change given on a transaction, meaning ‘you’re in for an
unpleasant surprise.’
Adventure Seeds
An Old Nag: The party buys a horse from a coper, only to discover a
few days later that it is far older than advertised, and is in fact nearing
the end of its life. The characters can spend time tracking down the

can move on, buy another horse from someone else, and take the lesson
for what it’s worth.
A Moral Dilemma: A horse coper hires one or more of the party to
act as his bodyguards. He claims he’s being targeted by criminals trying
to ruin him and take his goods, and puts forth an honest and sincere
face to the party. Everyone they meet universally despises the man, save
his own family, who worship him for being a good provider, father,
and husband. If he is killed, his children and widow will be run out
of town with only the clothes on their backs, forced to survive as best
they can in the harsh Kislev steppes while the townsfolk divide up their
possessions as “compensation.” Does the party defend a wicked man
and condemn his innocent family to certain death, or do they suffer a
wicked man to live?

Yuri Kovalenko
Yuri has seen more than his share of excitement and adventures. A
steppe nomad of the Ungol who went on to serve as a horse archer in
the armies of the Tsarina, Yuri has lived through interesting times. He
fought against the great Storm of Chaos.
He was at Mazhorod when Boyarin Kurkosk defeated an army of
Chaos. Now he has had enough of war and adventures, and simply
wants to be left alone with his horses. He breeds some of the finest
Kislevite warhorses in the land and is proud of his stock. The name
“Kovalenko” holds a great deal of prestige in certain circles, but such
fame means little to this proud horsemaster.
Yuri cannot entirely escape his past. On the battlefields of Mazhorod,
just before victory was won, a dying Chaos champion stumbled towards
Yuri. The Ungol put his final arrow in the fiend’s gut, and laid the
warped half-man low. The champion grasped in his hand a sparkling
red jewel that seemed to burn with its own inner fire. Yuri pocketed the
treasure and told no one.
Since then he has grown darker in his moods and more and more
isolated from his fellow men. There is a reason for this – Yuri has gained
his first Chaos mutation thanks to exposure to the arcane influence of
the jewel – a clawed hand. Yuri can feel himself changing and knows it
is only a matter of time before he transforms fully into a beast and goes
hunting for man-flesh. He hopes that by living far away and alone, he
can keep his shame secret.
The House of Shirkov
Members of the clan of Shirkov have been horsemasters and horse
copers for as long as any can remember. Still leading a nomadic
existence, they move from settlement to settlement, town to town,
leading their herd and trading for everything they may require. Such
travelling bands have a terrible reputation for harbouring thieves and
cheating their clients, but the truth is that the House of Shirkov is
nothing of the sort.
Patriarch Dimitri Shirkov demands honour and honesty from his entire

Hunter
The trail is old, but I can follow it. Go back to camp and start a cookfire. We’re eating coney tonight.
(Core) While the Empire has come far from the tribes that founded it 2500 years ago, some things
haven’t changed at all. Although Peasants till parts of the land, huge expanses of the Empire are still
covered with forest or are hostile to agriculture. These are the lands where Hunters and trappers thrive.
They use the same techniques as their ancestors to take down game, be it a trap or a well-placed
shot. It takes skill to stalk wild animals while avoiding the dark creatures of the woods. Hunters in
their animal skin clothes and fur hats may appear uncouth to city folks, but they don’t much care what
others think of them.

Tools of the Trade
Weaponry: The weapons used by hunters have changed little over
the centuries. While there have been advances in technology, such as
the advent of the crossbow and forged steel, hunters have hardly been
affected by the application of these developments. A crossbow functions
similarly to the bow, forged steel behaves similarly to iron.
Horn: In dense forest or grassy plain, the hunter requires a method
of communication with his fellow Hunters when game or danger is
spotted. The horn can also be used to call a trained animal.
Skinning Tools: The hunter requires a selection of specialised knives to
prepare and dress the kill for transport.
Horse: The domesticated horse is the hunter’s great equaliser against
speedy forest prey. The horse should be strong enough to carry the
hunter over long chases, agile enough to maneouvre through scrub and
underbrush, and fearless when encountering wild beasts. After the kill is
made, the horse can also help carry the meat home in a swift manner.
Dog: The trained hunting dog is indispensible to the solo hunter. A
well-trained canine will locate, drive and corner the prey as the hunter
moves in for the kill. Hunting dogs are trained to obey the signals of the
hunter’s horn.
Hawk: Sometimes, the wide-open plains where the herds run cover
too large an area for a dog to locate and chase game. In addition to its
prowess at hunting other birds or small game, a well-trained hawk can
also direct its master to larger prey.
The Master of the Hunt
When the nobility of the Empire goes hunting, they employ a specialist
hunter called the Master of the Hunt to ensure a successful venture. The
Master of the Hunt is a common position in most noble households.
It is this huntsman’s responsibility to locate the prey for his lord. The
lord then determines if the game is worth pursuing or not. If the lord is
pleased with the selection, the huntsman flanks the animal and begins
herding it towards the hunting party and the chase is on.
The Master of the Hunt and his lordship are always assured the widest
selection of game because they hunt in Imperial forests. An Imperial
forest is a large region of prime hunting land reserved for the sole use of
the Elector Count and his approved guests. As most Elector Counts are
busy with matters of state (and not hunting), protected Imperial forests
typically sit empty and teeming with game. Provincial law prescribes
harsh penalties on any form of poaching in an Imperial forest, and
the killing of a field hare carries the same punishment as the killing
of a stag. There is a popular misconception that Imperial forests are
restricted to wooded regions, and this is not the case. An Imperial forest
can include any type of terrain that supports wild game, whether it’s
grassland, wetland or plain.

Ice Maiden
A Cold Reception
Magdala Ostrovek, known as Mima to her childhood friends, had always
felt a certain affinity for the chill climes of her homeland. Visitors would
come and go, complaining of the bitter cold and the winds that howled
like wolves throughout the night. But to Mima, these were comforting
things.
It was on a particularly cold night, the air thick with hoarfrost and breath
of man and animal alike freezing as they breathed, that Magdala left her
village of Vostoya and ventured deep into the woods. To this day, she
cannot fully explain why she chose this night. Or why she felt compelled
to wander into the woods with naught but a cotton shift to keep her safe.
It was as if Magdala and the bitter chill had reached some sort of pact. A
mutual respect for each other; she a respect for the fearsome cold and the
power it held over life and death, the cold a respect for Magdala’s purpose
and destiny. For it was on this night that Magdala Ostrovek found the
carved ice hut of Babya Yigg, the Witch of the Woods that struck fear
into the hearts of the townfolk.
But no such fear touched Magdala’s heart. As she approached, Babya
Yigg greeted her at the door and draped a thick ice bear’s fur across the
young girl’s shoulders.
“I have been waiting for you,” the old witch said, a smile cracking her
withered face. Magdala remembers that Babya had the most amazing,
most intense eyes. As if hewn from a piece of the purest, coldest ice.
The eyes, that smile, the comforting embrace and warm furs. All these
things told Magdala that she had truly found her home. Vostoya was
already a fading memory, a place she once knew. This place is where she
would learn, grow and truly live, for the first time in her life.

The Lost Girls: Several young girls from nearby villages have gone

the young girls if necessary.
A Dark Homecoming: An Ice Maiden has been free from her mistresses’
care for several years when she unexpectedly receives a summons for aid.
Upon arriving, the Ice Maiden finds her mistresses’ domain blackened
and scorched, reduced to smouldering ruin. Amidst the rubble, is a silver
pendant shaped like a raven’s wing, the house sigil for a lord recently
claiming the mistresses lands as part of his sovereign lands.
Ice Maiden
The ice called to me, and I answered. That is all you need to know.
(RotIQ) When apprentice witches finish their training, they are released from
their mistresses to seek a deeper understanding of Ice Magic. To do this, they must
mirror the Ancient Widow as closely as possible, so they swear vows of chastity (to
represent being widowed) before forging forth with cold determination in their
hearts. Maidens of the ice can be found in the most unlikely places as they quest
for understanding, but most commonly, they wander the frozen oblast, facing
kyazak, the land’s spirits, and ferocious Greenskins with equal resolve. An ice
maiden’s vow of chastity ends when she gains insight into her wintry magic and
becomes a full ice witch; however, for some, this understanding never comes, and
they remain forever alone.

Ice Witch
Little Known Facts
Though they wear heavy winter clothing, this is more an affectation
than a true need. Ice witches are impervious to cold, for the Ice Magic
runs through their bodies and no other cold can compare.
Ice witches rarely die, at least not in the normal sense. Most ice witches,
when they feel their life ebbing away and their control and focus fading,
slip off into the wilds of Kislev. There they release the Ice Magic within,
letting it wash over them and transform them, making them one with
their power. Stories tell of places where frozen ice witches stand like
monuments to winter, each one turned to ice.
Notable Figures
Nadia Uneska Voreskova was born and raised in the north of Kislev,
not far from the River Lynsk. Her family was nomadic, like most of
the Kislevites in that region, and wandered from place to place seeking
pastures for their herds and food for themselves. It was a difficult
existence, and Nadia grew up strong and stern like her kin. When she
was old enough, she married a man from a neighbouring tribe and went
to live with his family.
Their first child was a little girl, Katya. On her tenth birthday Nadia
took her to the nearest village for the winter equinox celebration, and
presented her to the local ice witch. The witch saw no sign of magic
within Katya – but did discover a powerful spark in Nadia. Ice witches
are required to apprentice any Kislev female they find with the gift,
and so Nadia was told to leave her family behind. She refused. The
local ice witch, unaccustomed to disobedience, insisted. When Nadia
still refused, the witch attempted to coerce her with magic. With pure
instinct Nadia fought back and defeated the witch, turning her instantly
to ice. Frightened, Nadia took her daughter and fled back to her
husband and their tribe.
When the ice witches heard what had happened, they dispatched
another to investigate. The ice witch they sent, Madhyana Terleska, was
old, powerful, and accustomed to having her own way. She ascertained
that Nadia had defeated the ice witch in fair magical battle and sought
the woman out, assuring her that she would not be punished. However,
Madhyana insisted Nadia travel to the nearest surviving ice witch for
proper training. Again, Nadia refused. Nothing Madhyana said could
sway her, and finally the old ice witch surprised even herself by offering
a new solution. She joined Nadia’s tribe and trained the woman herself.
Under Madhyana’s tutelage Nadia quickly mastered the Ice Magic, but
she refused to follow the traditional path of the ice maiden – she would
not under any circumstances abandon her husband, her children, or
her tribe. In the end, Madhyana was forced to admit that Nadia was
a full-fledged ice witch and departed, half impressed and half afraid.
Since then Nadia has done her best to reconcile her two identities, and
uses her magic to protect her tribe and the northern edge of Kislev.
She refuses to leave them even to travel to one of the annual ice witch
gatherings.
Adventure Seeds
The Truth of Prophecy: Rumours have sprung up of a young man
who controls the Ice Magic as if he were a witch. This seems to be the
coming of a powerful figure foretold in legend, one who may taint the
Ice Magic forever. It is a day the ice witches have long feared. An ice
witch is dispatched to find this young man, check for any truth to the
rumour – and, if it is true, kill him before he can destroy their heritage.
Ice Witch
Now I call to the ice, and the ice answers. That is all you need to know.
(RotIQ) The ice witches of Kislev are feared and respected throughout the Old
World. They are the darkest winter, the coldest ice, and the cruellest blizzard, and
few can bear their presence for long. But being an ice witch is more than simply
practicing Ice Magic and defending Kislev from its foes. Ice witches are part of an
ancient sisterhood that has long influenced and often ruled the Gospodar tribe –
and still does to this day. They are in touch with the wintry spirits of the land and
the frozen flows of magic surging through it; thus, they work hard to preserve the
old ways and ancient places, keen to ensure their pristine magic remains unsullied
and pure.

Initiate
Faith is not given freely. It must be earned. I have been trying to earn it for many years now.
(Core) Religion has taken second place to money in the affections of many Old Worlders, but
there are still many young men and women willing to devote their lives to the Gods. It takes great
dedication and training to become a Priest. Initiates are Priests-in-training. They undergo harsh
instruction under strict teachers, and until they are finished they are not allowed to preach or
conduct services. Their training includes literacy and calligraphy, the study of scriptures, and the
art of the sermon. They also learn the basics of weapon use so the temple can be defended in times
of need.
Note: As an Initiate you must decide who your patron God is and what church you serve. You
can learn more about the faiths of the Old World in Chapter 8: Religion and Belief of the Core
Rulebook. Your choice gives you another skill or talent, as detailed in Church Skills and Talents entry of
your God’s description.

Becoming an Initiate
There are manifold reasons for devoting one’s life to divine service, and
not all of them involve faith. Many initiates have no choice in their
destiny, having been gifted to a cult at birth.
This is the fate of many orphans, the children of paupers, or the babies
especially religious parents who hope that gifting their child to a cult
will bring that god’s fortune on their family. In addition, the nobility
send their youngest sons to cult seminaries to avoid problems of
inheritance. These initiates are often the least willing pupils.
However, there are some who choose to become initiates in later life.
Perhaps a traumatic event has given them a profound religious insight,
or they have experienced a miraculous epiphany that fills them with the
zeal of faith. Or perhaps a person wishes to atone for a misdeed, to wash
away their remorse by devoting themselves to a holy vocation. Such
initiates are often the most passionate followers of their god, chastising
those who fail to match their own unbending righteousness.
Life of an Initiate
The life of an initiate involves arduous labour and long hours of study
and prayer. When they are not being educated with holy book and
hazel rod, initiates toil ceaselessly, cleaning the temple garderobes or
performing other unsavoury tasks the priests prefer not to touch.
This strict regime of labour is intended to hammer home to each
initiate that their only desire should be obeying the commands of
their superiors and the will of the god they serve. After several years of
intensive training, initiates are released from their temple to experience
life beyond its walls.
Before they can help their flock in spiritual matters, they must become
aware of the world and its pitfalls. Itinerant initiates discover how to
surmount life’s obstacles using only the teachings of their faith. When
they have learned how to accomplish this, they are allowed to return
to their temple to be ordained as fully-fledged priests, the proudest
moment of an initiate’s life.
Adventure Seeds
Holy Fervour: The adventuring party has been joined by an initiate of
Shallya. Her fervent belief in non-violence is often a source of conflict
in the group. Whenever the party encounters a situation best solved
with violence, are they prepared to endure the initiate’s fiery rhetoric,
or will they bow to her demands and seek a less bloody, and less
straightforward, solution?
The Wolves of Ulric: A party of adventurers on a mission in the
wintry wilderness, encounters a young man in rags wielding only a club,
being attacked by a group of wolfskin-clad warriors brandishing axes.
Unknown to the party, the lad is an initiate of Ulric, and his attackers
are priests from his temple staging an attack to test his strength. Should
the party charge in to rescue the lad and kill any of the priests, they will
become enemies of the local temple of the White Wolf.
Corruption on High: A Chaos cult is uncovered within a town’s
upper echelons, and a senior priest of the temple has been charged with
collusion. All of the temple’s priests are investigated during the resulting
trials. The initiates must work together to uncover the truth before the
town bands together against their entire order.

Every Man’s Hero
In towns and villages throughout civilised lands, taverns are a welcome
retreat for hard-working men – a place where they can drown out the
rigours of life with ale and song. As a consequence, innkeepers enjoy a
respect among this class usually accorded only to priests. Those same
priests castigate innkeepers for promoting drunkenness, gambling, and
other vices which lead men astray from family and temple.
In remote areas, innkeepers are the saviour of all weary travellers. When
darkness falls, the warm glow of the roadside inn is a welcome beacon
to those abroad. Rural inns are not just refuges from the chill of night.
Many, particularly those along the forest roads, are effectively small
fortresses. Palisades protect them against the fearsome denizens of the
dark, and their innkeepers are renowned as much for their fighting
ability as for the quality of their ale.
Old Spot
Perhaps the most famous innkeeper in the Empire is the Ostermarker,
Jander “Old Spot” Wergnen. His inn, the Old Spotted Dog, enjoys a
thriving trade, despite his tavern’s location in the foothills of the World’s
Edge Mountains.
Old Spot treats his guests as kings, and serves Lector’s Tipple, annual
winner at the Bechafen Beer Fair. Even dwarfs grudgingly acknowledge
the Old Spotted Dog as a passable place to drink, and each year a
pilgrimage of halflings arrives from the Moot to taste his succulent pies.
However, it is not only the quality of his establishment that secured
Wergnen’s fameTen years ago, during one of Ostermark’s worst winters,
a giant stomped down from the mountains through blinding snow. It
sniffed out the aroma of the Old Spotted Dog, and the few trappers
and traders holed up in the inn fled into the storm. However, Old Spot
stood between his tavern and the giant, blunderbuss loaded. The giant
ignored the innkeeper’s warnings to turn back, and so Old Spot fired.
Unfortunately, snow had dampened the gun’s black powder, and it
misfired. The giant grabbed him and swallowed him whole. Amazingly,
the innkeeper survived the descent into the pitch black of the monster’s
gut. And more amazingly, he managed to retain his wits about him.
Fumbling for his tinderbox, Old Spot struck a light to search for a way
out. The sparks ignited gastric gas, and in the resultant explosion, Old
Spot was hurled to safety in a shower of gore to land in a snowdrift. The
giant, clutching its spilled intestines, toppled and died. Its skull now
adorns the front entrance, a trophy attracting many visitors who wish to
hear the tale from the great man himself.

methods to extract information from their charges and neither is very pleasant. Interrogators
work for Witch Hunters and Nobles and sometimes for the more zealous churches. They
pride themselves on their efficiency, though many achieve it with excessive brutality. The best
Interrogators know that discovering the truth is an art form. People lie and obfuscate and will
say nearly anything to make the pain stop. Getting a confession is easy; getting to the truth is
altogether more difficult.

Karlos of Kislev
Many stumble into the job of interrogator due to a certain unconcern
for the pain of others and a reasonable talent for inflicting it. The world
often asks an individual to be either the producer of pain, or the bearer
of it, and it’s hardly unnatural that many choose the latter.Sometimes,
however, there are those who seem born to the task.
Karlos is an artist, surrounded by brutes. While others would use pain
as a means to an end, to him, the pain was the end, and the act of
interrogation the most dull and banal part of the job. He has drifted
from employer to employer – always hired for his expertise, always
dismissed for his unconcern with actually discovering information.
He has worked with witch hunters, but even they dismiss him, because
he doesn’t even put up a front of caring about heretics or magic. He just
wants the ability to earn money doing what he loves – hurting people.
Karlos can be found almost anywhere in the Old World, plying his trade
for whoever will employ him. If he encounters a fellow interrogator, he
may decide to test them to see if they have the same spark he does, and
pass along his skills if they do. If they don’t...well...sometimes he works
for free.
To the Pain
Interrogators normally work in a controlled environment, with
their subjects suitably restrained and a wide assortment of sharp
implements at their disposal – however, their quarry is not always so
accommodating.
An interrogator’s knowledge of human anatomy and precisely applied
pressure to nerve points can be extremely useful in dangerous situations.
Many foolhardy combatants have underestimated the skill and precision
of an interrogator. Whether armed with a sharp scalpel, fiery hot pincers
or even a simple iron prod, in the hands of a skilled interrogator, such
items can be as fearsome or deadly as a longsword in the hands of a
battle-hardened knight.
A sturdy breastplate or heavy coat of chain may stop most of the blows
– but there are always gaps in the armour, exposing sensitive areas of the
body to the interrogator’s tools. With the right amount of force applied
to just the right area, a single blow can fell even the strongest warrior.
Adventure Seeds
The Guild’s Secrets: A high ranking member of the merchants
guild has been kidnapped, and the guild fears he will be tortured into
revealing information vital to the guild’s operations. The characters have
been asked to track down and rescue the man, and “deal with” those
involved. Sometimes, asking questions means you learn answers other
people don’t want you to know. If the party hears too much, their lives
may be at risk, too.
False Confessions: Interrogators often work in private, for obvious
reasons. This opens up some possibilities for corruption, and an
interrogator tasked with tracking down Chaos cultists in a town is
instead using his position to do just the opposite – to torture the
innocent and report false “confessions,” while letting the true cultists go
after only mild discomfort.

Jailer
Good morning, master thief. Did you enjoy the face branding yesterday? I can see that you did. And how
are you enjoying the accommodations? More lip from you and I’ll be glad to brand the other cheek.
(Core) The Empire is a nation of laws, which means it’s also a nation of jails. Despite the best
efforts of the clergy of Verena, the Goddess of Justice, the innocent are just as likely as the guilty
to end up in jail. Better too harsh than too lax is the opinion of the law. Imperial jails are foul
dungeons that smell equally of fear and excrement. Jailers preside over these institutions, using
a combination of brutality and humiliation to keep order. Jailers generally have no sense of
justice or pity, and are seldom swayed by pleas or speeches (though bribes are gladly accepted).
The worst are outright sadists, delighting in the power they hold over their charges.

The Empire’s Strange Penal Code
It is assumed by most of their ‘guests’ that jailers are simply brutish
sadists who enjoy torturing them. And while certainly this is true of
some, many jailers are bound by an archaic and often bewildering code
of laws.
For example, in Altdorf it is illegal for a jailer to beat a prisoner with a
club thicker than this thumb. In Middenheim, any prisoner that will be
executed must be fed roast beef.
The city with the most and widest variety of bizarre and even laughable
penal laws, is Talabheim. In Talabheim, prisoners must wear colourcoded
tabards according to their most heinous crime. This bizarre
selection of often garish colours (yellow for theft, red for murder, green
for forgery, pink for rape, and white and grey stripes for treason, to give
a few examples) creates a prison that to one observer’s eye looks more
like a circus than a jail.
Friedl Grützmüller, Jailer of Brissenwald
Friedl is almost terrifyingly ugly. Born hunched and marked by pox in
his youth, he looks the typical jailer – a horrid monster eager to torture
prisoners. Friedl puts on a good show whenever the warden or nobility
come around – slurring his speech, whipping any prisoner who steps
out of line wildly, and so forth.
But in truth, Friedl runs the most comfortable and easiest jails in the
Empire. Located right outside of Nuln, Brissenwald receives a lot of
prisoners from that bustling hub of trade and crime. Friedl is on the
payroll of multiple crime lords within that city and he provides them
with a valuable service. When one of the crime lord’s men gets caught,
and simply getting them off isn’t an option, a bribed official will send
that man “to the hell that is Brissenwald.”
Friedl ensures (for no small fee) that his guests’ needs are taken care of.
In fact, Friedl is more an innkeeper than a jailer, seeing that his clients
are well-fed and stay in relative comfort. A few well-chosen women of
the night (paid as much for their discretion as anything else), work the
prison under Friedl’s supervision.
Wine is served with supper. The guards are hand chosen to make sure
they understand what this job requires and are well paid for their
silence. However, nothing will help any prisoner sent to Brissenwald
who can not pay Friedl’s fees. After all, someone has to be made
example of when the local lords visit.

Exchanging Favors: The party needs someone in jail, out. Who holds
the keys? Why, a jailer, of course. He certainly is willing to let the
person go, if the party could help him with a little matter involving his
gambling debts and a local racketeer.
Scouring the Dungeons: A jailer has been selling corpses of dead
prisoners to a local physician for his studies of anatomy. While this
is illegal in and of itself, there is loose talk that the jailer hasn’t been
waiting for prisoners to die. And perhaps the “physician” is also more
than he seems. Is there any truth to the stories about undead in the
cemetery and a necromancer in residence at a hidden crypt?

Journeyman Runesmith
A Day in the Life
With apprenticeship done, the runesmith must now test his skills out
in battle. He leaves his home and family, and begins to travel the world.
His daily life can vary a great deal. If he finds a place at a dwarf hold, he
might spend most of his day smithing, carving and studying lore. If he
becomes a wanderer, he may pass through towns, dwarf or otherwise, to
provide his skills where they are needed.
Some choose to find non-dwarf patrons, such as knights of the Empire,
who will benefit from their skill and provide them with enough money
to keep up with their practise. A journeyman runesmith will send a
constant stream of messages back to their old master, though, asking for
advice, commenting on things learned, and so on.
It is the hope of every journeyman to either discover something new, for
example, how a mix of different polishing oils can enhance the power
of a carving, or something old, such as a forgotten tome of carving lore.
Journeymen take such discoveries as a sign that it is time to progress
onward in their studies.
Of course, sometimes a dwarf will depart the road to mastery. Time
spent alongside fighting men might cause a journeyman to move to a
more martial career, leaving behind the somewhat scholarly pursuit of
the runesmith. This happens more often than master runesmiths let on;
they see the journeyman stage as a time to test the true dedication of
their apprentice, when he is subject to distraction and is made aware of
all the opportunities in life. Those who return to continue their craft are
the ones truly worthy to master it.
Little Known Facts
Journeymen often try to find things no one else in their family has
done, or at least not recently. Some will travel hundreds of miles to
attach themselves to Tilean or Kislevite humans. Others experiment
boldly, trying a hundred different variations on the same rune to see
if they can discover something new. It can often be dangerous to be
around such tinkerers, as an accident can unleash a terrible magical
explosion.
While it is very rare, and utterly unacceptable, sometimes, a
journeyman will teach the basics of runesmithing to another dwarf, one
not of the proper lineage. This can be scandalous at best, and both the
journeyman and his “apprentice” may be shamed and exiled from their
community as a result.
Adventure Seeds
The Twice-Runed Blade: A journeyman has heard the legend of a
blade which holds two master runes – supposedly impossible! While his
friends and teachers tell him this is a hoax, it has become an obsession
with him, and he is determined to track down this item, claim it and
master the techniques it embodies.
The Fallen: A journeyman who has been working with the troops of
an Empire noble is rudely accosted by battered soldiers, who claim
that his runes failed in battle and that their commander died due to his
misplaced faith in “the strange magic of the dwarfs.” He is sure that he
did nothing wrong – why did the runes fail (if they did) and how can he
redeem his reputation?
Journeyman Runesmith
It’s good. But not good enough. You can wield it if you want, human. I don’t want to see it again.
(RoS) Journeyman Runesmiths complete the fundamentals of their training and are elevated by their
master to learn the deeper secrets of their craft. Instead of instruction, though, these Runesmiths
are expected to venture out into the world in search of ancient magical treasures to bring back for
study. Furthermore, these Dwarfs must take their accumulated knowledge and learn additional
Runes from their independent study and experimentation. At the end of the Journeyman
period, the Runesmith may return to his master to demonstrate his skill. If found worthy, the
master might elevate the student to the full status of Master Runesmith and teach him the
secrets of the Master Runes.
Note: Only Dwarfs can enter this career.

Learning things man was not meant to know is our job. We learn them so that you don’t have to.
(Core) Human Journeymen Wizards have completed their apprenticeship and joined an Order of
Wizardry. They now have access to all the spells of their chosen lore, but they must balance their
newfound powers with their faltering ability to control them. The majority of Journeymen owe
considerable teaching fees to their College, and must adventure to repay their debt. Journeymen
Wizards hire out their services, often at their Orders’ request, for gold, knowledge and political
betterment of their College. Elves, of course, are exempt from the College system, and owe

A Day in the Life
Journeyman wizards no longer have a master, which means they must
get themselves out of bed before dawn to seize some time for study
before the work of the day. The nature of that work varies a great deal,
but they use magic less than most people imagine. Their control of the
lore of their wind is still unreliable, so magic remains a last resort.
Of course, when the College has sent them to investigate a greenskin
infestation or support a witch hunter, the last resort may be needed
most days. Even then, journeymen do not spend all their time casting
spells.
The reputation that wizards have for being obsessively bookish is due
in no small part to the behaviour of journeyman wizards. Almost all
of them are desperate to become master wizards, with lower dues and
fewer responsibilities, and a significant amount of study is needed to
achieve their goal. However, the tasks they are given often leave little
time for study, so most journeymen seize any opportunity to read, no
matter how short.
Magdalena Thaurstein
Magdalena is a journeyman in the Amethyst College, and is widely
believed to have been cursed. She is dedicated and motivated, and at
least averagely bright and strong-willed for a wizard. However, she
has been a journeyman for over 15 years, and still shows no signs of
reaching the standard of a master.
Many of Magdalena’s tasks have ended in disasters that she has barely
survived, leaving her to pick up the pieces, and distracting her from
her studies. On at least three occasions she has been on the verge of
promotion, when an encounter with some strange monster stripped
her of some of her knowledge, or exposed her to Chaos taint that the
Masters wished to be sure had been cleansed.
She seems to have avoided becoming bitterand strikes most people as
resigned to her dispiriting fate.
Adventure Seeds
Debts to Pay: The journeyman wizard is visited by three senior
representatives of his College, who show him evidence that he is
behind on repaying his tuition. They offer to overlook the default if he
undertakes a particular mission for them – an offer he can hardly refuse.
However, the character has been dutifully paying what he owed, so
either somebody within the College has been embezzling, or someone
has a grudge against him. Either way, if he doesn’t get to the bottom
of the problem, he will face trouble in the future. But first, there’s that
mission.
An Eager Pupil: Needing to travel to a distant city, the journeyman
wizard hires on as a guard with a wealthy merchant, who is initially
delighted at his luck, but much less friendly when the wizard actually
joins the group. The merchant is travelling with his son or daughter,
who becomes quite infatuated with the great wizard travelling with
them. Before long, the wizard realises the adolescent has magical
potential. In addition, someone is systematically searching the goods
being carried, a little every night.

Judicial Champion
You got nothing to fear if you are innocent. But my sword ain’t met no innocent men yet.
(Core) A number of Old World countries legally allow a defendant to proof his
innocence via trial by combat. The accused are usually pitted against the local
Judicial Champion, a professional fighter who specializes in defeating a single
opponent swiftly and efficiently. Many of the laws that allow such combats
state that specific weapons must be used; meaning Judicial Champions are
well versed with a wide variety of arms. Correspondingly, Judicial Champions
are both respected and feared warriors, whose prowess often precedes them.
Noble defendants and the wealthy may sometimes be capable of hiring a Judicial
Champion to fight in their place.

Justice by Combat
Trials by combat are most common in the northern and eastern reaches
of the Empire, where folk respect a weapon’s reach more than the letters
of law. While the judicial champion usually fights for an established
judge or magistrate, in more remote places the champion himself is the
word as well as the weapon of law.
The rules for a judicial combat are set before the combatants enter
the designated arena. Typical rules are: Combatants fight unarmed if
the defendant has committed a minor offence, or if the defendant has
been accused of crimes against people, the fight involves bladed or
spiked weapons, but if he has committed a felony against property or
commerce, the combatants wield less lethal weapons, such as clubs or
quarterstaffs.
Judicial combat is often fought to first blood to decide minor offences,
but to the death for more serious accusations. Sometimes a judge might
rule that the accused must defeat two or more of his champions to prove
his innocence. If a defendant loses the battle but survives, scars gained
or limbs lost in the course of a judicial combat are a physical reminder
of his guilt, and a deterrent to those who might be tempted to repeat
his crime. If the accused defeats a judicial champion, he is acquitted of
all charges, though if he kills his opponent during a non-lethal bout, he
may be immediately arraigned for murder!
Bardin “Justhammer”
Bardin’s original clan name is unknown. Even decades-long friends
have only known his appellation of “Justhammer.” The earliest rumours
about Bardin are that he was a pit fighter in the eastern Ostermark more
than 50 years ago. He bought his freedom, but none knows how the
dwarf became a slave in the first place. They also said he was amazing to
watch in the pits, his ability to turn nearly anything into a weapon often
turning the tables on his foes.
Bardin fought for decades alongside many veteran adventurers, battling
beastmen, greenskins, and other fiends of Chaos in the northern
wilderness and along the Sea of Claws. Nearly twenty years ago, Bardin
forged his signature great hammer, its massive head carved with the
Khazalid rune of “justice” on one side, the scales of Verena on its other.
Tallis Surcheit, a Verenan high priest in Lieske, and Bardin’s former
comrade, confesses he learned little about the taciturn dwarf, but he
trusts Bardin’s sense of justice over that of many judges across the
Empire.
Today, Bardin resides in Hergig where he served as bailiff and jailer
before being appointed the role of Judicial Champion. The Dwarf’s
prowess and reputation alone has lessened crime in and around Hergig.
For while not every magistrate ruling results in combat, the thought of
facing Bardin “Justhammer” in combat is itself a deterrent.
While approaching his middle years (for a Dwarf), Bardin remains in
excellent fighting form. When he is angry, scars that criss-cross Bardin’s
face, hands, arms, and torso seem to glow red. Bardin lets others talk,
always choosing words and actions carefully. Any tavern in Hergig
quiets when he speaks, eager to catch every wise word.
Adventure Seeds

Killer of the Dead
A Day In The Life
The day is for sleeping, when they find it harder to come for you. For
some, the day is for sleeping in a cave in natural stone, strong and
protected, a rock blocking the entrance, clutching a stake, because some
of them will come for you anyway. The day is not for them. But perhaps
it will be cloudy. Perhaps it will rain. Then they need not fear the sun.
Once night falls, you must move, quickly, away from the places you
visited the previous night. They may have been watching you and set an
ambush, or be prepared to strike at your lair as soon as it is dark. Rise
before the sunset, to be away and hidden before they can act.
Night is for hunting. Watch the people who go out at night, for normal
folk have no need to skulk around when the sun sleeps. You are no
longer one of the normal folk, if you ever were, for you have a stronger
calling now, one that calls louder than laws and fellowship. Those who
walk by night may be the undead; watch their habits carefully.
When you have tracked one of them down, strike early in the night if
possible, and dismember and burn the corpse so that it does not rise
again. Then flee, as fast as you can, before their allies can track you. Do
not concern yourself with your destination. Wherever you find yourself,
they will be waiting.
Little Known Facts
Killers of the Dead train suitable candidates when they find them,
and two who meet often work together for a time. It is important to
remember that they are obsessive, but not quite what most would term
insane, at least not in most cases.
A very small number of Killers of the Dead even maintain a respectable
facade, with the help of a wealthy family or group of friends. These
backers must be very tolerant, however, as nothing can be allowed to
come before the hunt.
Once one has taken the path of a Killer of the Dead, life is bleak. It is
rare for a Killer of the Dead to ever pursue another path. Their devotion
and single-minded purpose makes it difficult to adjust to any other way
of life.
Adventure Seeds
A Unique Undead? The Killer of the Dead hears rumours of a
vampire who has none of the normal weaknesses, happily operating in
daylight, casting a reflection, ignoring religious symbols, and no more
inconvenienced by stakes than a human would be. If these rumours are
true, such a creature could wreak unimaginable destruction. If false,
who would spread such rumours? Someone needs to get to the bottom
of this mystery.
A Mysterious Patron: The Killer of the Dead returns to his current lair
to find clothes piled up there. He recognises them as having belonged
to a victim of the last vampire he killed, one who left a family. Over
the next few days, other supplies, and finally food are left, always while
he is absent. This mysterious benefactor goes to great lengths to avoid
direct contact with the Killer of the Dead. Then a small portrait is
left, of a person in the town casting no reflection, intimating that the
person is a vampire. Is the claim real, or is the Killer of the Dead being
manipulated by the benefactor to hunt an innocent person?
Killer of the Dead
Stake in the heart, cut off the head, burn it to ash, douse in holy water, scatter the ashes in four different
provinces. Kills them nine times in ten.
(NDM) Few survive the life of a Vampire hunter. Of those who do, many quickly turn to other
careers, such as the legitimacy of Witch Hunter or the better provisions of knighthood. Those
who do not become Killers of the Dead. Having seen the true horror of the Vampires and the
infinite legions of the restless dead, they can never look away, and they devote their every
waking moment to destroying this unrelenting enemy. Even more shunned and mistrusted
than Vampire hunters, these fanatics typically become hermits or outlaws, stealing what
they need to survive, so they have no distractions from their cause. Their devotion to their
mission means these killers often get good enough to earn notoriety amongst the Vampires – and
knowing this, every killer sleeps restlessly, stake in hand, waiting to feel fangs upon his neck and hear
the sound of vengeful laughter in his ear.

(Core) Originally, the Kossars were an Ungol tribe that lived northeast of the Empire. An eastern people
known as the Gospodars invaded this region, subjugated the Ungols, and founded the nation of Kislev.
During this conflict, the Kossars sold their skills to the Gospodars as Mercenaries, fighting against other
Ungol tribes. Their unique style of fighting impressed the Gospodar nobility, and since that time Kossar
regiments have served the Tzars of Kislev. These days the Kossars are no longer a tribe, but a tough military
unit drawn from all over Kislev. They are armed with bows and great axes, making them quite flexible on
the battlefield. Many Kossars, tired of the ceaseless warfare of their native land, travel to the Empire to
become Mercenaries or adventurers.

Little Known Facts
When an Ungol or Gospodar man joins the Kossars, he’s expected to
leave clan loyalties behind and fight solely for the Tsarina and Kislev.
In times of war, Kislev’s often volatile mixture of Ungol and Gospodar
cultural difference melt away in the face of a common foe. In times of
peace, however, clan differences cause friction and Kislev’s patchwork of
conciliatory laws creates more problems than it solves. Over time, the
Tzars of Kislev have observed that Kossar morale improves when they’re
exempted from culturally divisive laws. Minor criminal charges against
Kossars are therefore routinely ignored, and their partial immunity has
given them an inflated sense of entitlement. Arbitrary punishments have
proven mostly ineffective for restoring discipline.
When convenient, however, Kossars use certain laws to their advantage.
For example, Gospodar Kossars often cite clan solidarity laws from
the Ungol tradition when civilians file charges against one of their
number. Likewise, Ungol Kossars wishing to defect are quick to adopt
the Gospodar custom of “finding Ursun,” which allows every man one
opportunity to abandon his responsibilities for a full month and wander
the oblast in search of spiritual guidance. Kossars who defect in this
manner usually travel south for greener pastures, never to return.
Bokha Palace Guard
Bohka Palace in the city of Kislev is guarded by three hundred of
Tzarina Katarin’s most loyal Kossars. These soldiers play a vital part in
the Ice Queen’s plans to expand the standing army with cavalry, and to
gradually phase out Ungol law in Kislev.
 The Palace Guard conducts weekly parades through the city. Recent
parades have featured small units of mercenary cavalry from the
Empire and Tilea marching alongside the Kossars. Katarin hopes these
cavalrymen will come to be accepted as part of the Palace Guard and
will eventually be replaced by Winged Lancers. If one rota of Winged
Lancers accepts the honour of serving in the Palace Guard, then others
will surely follow.
The Palace Guard is also a recruitment pool for Katarin’s secret police
(or Chekists). Ungols who serve in the Palace Guard are watched closely.
The most trusted are enticed with rewards to train with the Chekists
and return to their home villages as “legal advisors.” Their mission
usually involves persuading village elders to “modernise” outdated
Ungol laws. Gospodar Chekists are occasionally recruited from the
Palace Guard as well, but not as frequently, or deliberately, as Ungols.
Kislev’s regular Kossars are becoming resentful of the Palace Guard,
having watched them receive additional wages and perks even as their
own wages are lowered.
Adventure Seeds
Civil Disobedience: Kislevite immigrants have been refused hunting
and fishing rights in an Imperial province, and families are starving
as a result. A rally has been organised to protest the baron’s draconian
policy. The Kislevites need trained warriors, just in case the situation
becomes ugly.
Nightmares Come True: The Kossar is haunted by recurring
nightmares of crimes committed by his old regiment against innocent
civilians. If the Kossar seeks help from a priest or mystic, he’s told that
the Pleasure Lord has a hold on his soul, and that only by confronting
his personal daemons firsthand will he ever sleep peacefully.

Kithband Warrior
There are dark things lurking within these woods. Be wary.
(Core) Some Elves live in secluded glades deep inside the great forests. As the taint of
Chaos has become worse, these Elven lands have declined. Within the Empire few Elven
communities are left, the largest being in Laurelorn. Beneath the boughs of the forest
the Elves fight a hidden battle with Beastmen and other foul creatures. Small units of
warriors, known as Kithbands, take the fight to the enemy. As their name indicates,
Kithbands are made up of Elves from related family groups and they fight under their
clan emblems. These skilled bowmen protect the Elf settlements from the dark things of
the wood. Every bow is needed to stave off the destruction of the remaining Elf lands of
the Empire.

Affiliations
Kithband warriors who wander out into the lands of the Old World
can feel like fish out of water, and may soon want for understanding
company. Many men of the Empire feel rather distrustful of elves,
suspicious of their fey and mysterious nature. Some of this distaste does
stem from actions taken by elves, but mostly it is due to a subconscious
bitterness men bear towards them because of their grace and longevity.
The priests of Taal and Rhya are more understanding. They know
something of elven ways and are keen to keep on good terms with the
folk of the woodland. Magisters of the Amber and Jade Colleges also
tend to be less ignorant of elves than other men of the Empire.
Elven communities in human lands are not common, but there
are sizeable Elven quarters in some cities, such as Marienburg and
L’Anguille. While there can be friction between elves and mankind,
most cities grudgingly welcome the addition of these talented strangers.
Notable Figure: Aeleador Truesight
As a youth, Aeleador readily admitted a sense of ennui to his elders in
the Laurelorn forest, and told them he desired to travel the lands of the
Empire. The elders were loathe to let one of their much needed archers
go wandering, and they deliberated with Aeleador regarding his rather
eccentric wish.
However, his mind was set. The sent him on his way with the traditional
warning, that he was never to let anyone know about life in Laurelorn
or how to find the elves dwelling there, on pain of never being allowed
to return.
Aeleador travelled first to the city of Middenheim, but was so struck by
the alien nature of the stone buildings crammed together on a pinnacle
of rock, that he turned south and made for Delberz instead.
He receives a great deal of attention, for an elf travelling alone along the
roads of the Empire is not a common sight. The rushed pace of human
life, juxtaposed with their lumpish and ungainly physical appearance,
is bewildering to Aeleador, but he remains fascinated by it all the same.
At the same time, he is horrified to see how wastefully humans treat the
land, with their inefficient farms and their polluting industries.
Adventure Seeds
The Cult of the Red Crown: The cult is very interested to know more
about the elven community in Laurelorn. These devotees of Tzeentch
help raise and equip forces of beastmen and mutants within the forests
of the Empire, planning one day to unleash a mighty army that will
sweep all before it. Many times their forces have been cut down by
elven arrows, and some members of the cult believe it’s very important
to wipe the elves of Laurelorn out before they can muster their forces
unmolested. Because of this they will be very keen to ‘talk’ to any
kithband warriors they notice travelling about the Empire.
A Dying Request: Whilst travelling, an adventuring party come across
a heavily-wounded elf who tells a tale of making a miraculous escape
from a goblin raiding party. He has been tortured, and to his shame,
divulged the location of a hidden elf community to the greenskins. He
now seeks the goblins before they can do any further damage and urges
the PCs to help him chase and kill his quarry. Of course, should one
of the PCs be a kithband warrior they will feel obliged to provide their
kinsman with assistance.

A Day in the Life
The knight lives wakes in luxurious surroundings, as he is typically a
member of the nobility or amongst the most valued retainers of the
gentry. He is attended to by his Squire, a young man who hopes to earn
a knighthood himself one day and acts as a Knight’s personal assistant
until such time.
He spends much of the day in training, practising on foot or horseback
whilst wearing a suit of armour. The knight practises combat on foot,
honing his skills with sword and shield, or he will mount his horse
to charge at a quintain, a training dummy designed to improve his
accuracy with the lance.
In the evening the knight attends to courtly matters, socialising among
the aristocracy at dances, feasts, and other entertainments. The knight
plays a relatively minor role at such occasions, usually there simply to
flatter the lords and flirt with the ladies. Should talk turn to military
matters he will take a more active role, giving his opinions and advice to
any who who listen.
From time to time the knight will be called to fight. This will often be
the mock battles of the tourney field, where the knight will pit himself
against others using blunt swords and hollow lances. Despite the many
precautions taken tournaments are still dangerous tests of skill, leading
some unkind commentators to draw a comparison between knights and
pit fighters. However, it is when war breaks out that the Knight proves
his worth. Knights that are otherwise engaged may pay scutage (or
shield duty) to avoid military service, but many proudly and ably join
the elite shock cavalry of the armies of the Old World.
Affiliations
Knights walk in two distinct circles, the military and the aristocracy.
They provide the soldiers of the Old World with leadership drawn from
the nobility (which a great many consider important and proper), as
well as devastating cavalry charges known to break entire armies with
their fury. Knights earn the respect their more courtly peers do not by
demonstrating a willingness to appear on the field of battle and play an
important part in the swirling melee of combat.
At court, knights provide the nobility with military advisors who speak
their own language and sympathise with the concerns of statecraft.
Whilst common soldiers may have more battlefield experience than
many knights, they usually lack the education and perspective requisite
to see the bigger picture of warfare and politics, and so are rarely called
on to act as advisors.
Adventure Seeds
A Call to Arms: One of the noble lords of the Empire is
warmongering (again). He plans to defend the Empire by crusading
against one of its many enemies. All knights currently associated with
his court are expected to join in his military adventure, or compensate
him in some other fashion.
Raising the Stakes: A tournament is being held at an important town
in the Empire to mark a holiday, and knights from all around are
arriving to compete. However some individual has conspired to sow
confusion and distrust throughout the knights by replacing some of the
hollow lances with military grade weapons.

Knight Errant
Thou hast not heard of me nor of mine great deeds? Let me rectify that.
(KotG) Knights of the Empire start their careers following after some other knight, acting as nothing
more than a servant. What else would you expect from a nation who has forgotten the true meaning
of chivalry, the true meaning of honour, and the true meaning of courage?
In Bretonnia, knights start off riding their own trail, as they set off on their errantry tour.
Bretonnian knights learn from the best school there is: genuine experience. At the start of their
tour, they don’t have any genuine experience, but most make up the deficit with their enthusiasm.
Knights Errant are expected to travel widely, often alone, seeking out perilous situations in which
to prove their worth. As a result, they can be found anywhere in the Old World, sometimes to the
regret of the natives.

Little Known Facts
Knights errant are, by their very nature, young and inexperienced.
Once the king or a senior noble feels the knight errant has had enough
experience and proven his skill and bravery, he promotes the knight to a
Knight of the Realm.
Knights errant tend to travel a great deal, seeking every opportunity to
win acclaim, and so they usually travel with few worldly possessions.
Most knights errant carry their arms and armour, their horse’s gear, one
or two sets of basic clothing, a few small coins, some food, and a few
personal items.
Some knights cover their shields, hiding their heraldic device to show
that they are seeking experience and justice rather than personal glory.
This rarely happens with a knight errant, however. They are, after all,
trying to establish their reputation, and so they take every opportunity
to display their device and proclaim their name and lineage.
Knights errant are renowned for answering any and all calls to arms.
They are also the first in line for any charge and the last to retreat, as
their headstrong nature overwhelms their common sense and their sense
of strategy.
Notable Figures
Sir Tomas the Shieldless is renowned among the younger knights of
Bretonnia. A poor young stablehand, his life changed one night when
he aided an old knight battling a pack of brigands. Out of gratitude, the
knight, Sir Geoffrey, took Tomas as his squire.
Tomas served Sir Geoffrey faithfully for two years, until the day they
had the misfortune to run into the same brigands a second time. They
drove off the brigands again, but this time Sir Geoffrey was mortally
wounded. Before he died he knighted Tomas and bequeathed his
armour, weapons, and horse to the youth.
The armour was old and dented but still serviceable, the horse in good
health, the sword well-kept – but the knight’s shield had been shattered
by a heavy mace blow. Tomas threw it aside, vowing that he would carry
no shield until he had earned a heraldic device of his own, and charged
off to find the men who had killed his mentor.
Sir Tomas continues his search for his patron’s murderers to this day. He
has won some fame as an honest knight with decent sword skills and
excellent horsemanship. However, he has yet to earn the rank of Knight
of the Realm, so he continues to travel and to try proving his worth.
Adventure Seeds
Deaths in the Woods: Someone – or something – has been killing
travellers as they pass through the forest. The victims’ bodies are never
found, and the few steeds recovered have been terrified into madness.
This seems the perfect chance for a knight errant to prove his worth!
A False Knight: A young maiden stumbles into the inn one night,
calling for help. She claims a cruel knight invaded her home and now
torments her parents and makes unwanted advances toward her sister.
She escaped to seek aid. How could any knight errant refuse such a
damsel? However, is all as it seems?

Knight of the Blazing Sun
For glory! For honour! For Myrmidia!
(SH) The Knights of the Blazing Sun are an order of templars dedicated to Myrmidia, Goddess of Soldiers
and Strategy. Their order has spread from Tilea and Estalia in recent centuries, championing their cult’s values
in battles across the Old World. Gathering as a large force only rarely, they instead travel in small groups or
individually, acting as advisors to nobles and their generals on the art of war. Sometimes they command
units or whole armies in the field, using their skills and reputation to keep militia troops from breaking and
mercenaries loyal. More and more in the south of the Empire, the Knights of the Blazing Sun and the Cult
of Myrmidia are seen as a challenge to the martial primacy of the Cult of Ulric and the Knights of the
White Wolf.
At some point in his career, a Knight of the Blazing Sun will be sent out on his own
for one to two years, to test what he has learned and forge his skills in the crucible of
combat. Many an isolated village, farmstead, or coaching inn has been saved by a young Knight
taking charge of the defence.

A Day in the Life
A Knight of the Blazing Sun lives in a similar fashion as other knights,
but there are some notable differences. The knights spend a great deal
of time training in rather unusual methods of warfare, unafraid to
experiment with ploys, tactics, and equipment other Knightly Orders
might overlook. Many of the Knights are fine archers, leading to the
formation of the Knights of the Verdant Field. Some of the knights use
highly burnished shields, employed to dazzle the knights’ opponents
with reflected sunlight.
The knights also spend a deal of time in the discussion of broader
military tactics, the deployment and manoeuvre of entire armies, use of
terrain, and placement of artillery. While all knights have a grounding
in military theory, the greatest tacticians in the Empire may be found
within the ranks of the Knights of the Blazing Sun.
Affiliations
The Knights of the Blazing Sun are noted for their devotion to
Myrmidia, and work alongside the priests of her cult. The Knights
are known to travel regularly to Estalia and Tilea to visit important
members of the cult and listen to their plans and concerns.
The knights have their chapterhouse in Carroburg, and have extensive
contacts and influence in the city and its surroundings. They have
fought alongside the armies of Carroburg on many occasions and are
regarded as heroes by many people in the city.
The Knights of the Verdant Field are an offshoot of the Knights of
the Blazing Sun. The two orders sometimes train together, using elite
archery to compliment the devastating cavalry charges. This relationship
means that the Knights of the Blazing Sun are also regularly seen in
the city of Talabheim, and they have many contacts with the nobility,
military forces, and cult of Myrmidia there.
The Knights of the Blazing Sun are generally seen as a valuable
contribution to the Empire’s military who are often consulted for
strategic advice. However, members of the cult of Ulric can be
dismissive of the Knights of the Blazing Sun, regarding those who look
to Myrmidia for military inspiration as unwise and unmanly.
Adventure Seeds
The Statue: Some elements of the Knights of the Blazing Sun claim
that the great brass statue that fell upon the Black Guard of Emir
Wasr now has its spiritual home in Carroburg. Some members of the
Myrmidian cult in Magritta actually agree, as they reason it would help
spread the influence of the goddess in the north, but most swear that
they would rather die than give up their statue. Diplomatic relations
between the Empire and Estalia are not always cordial and Reikland
nobles have caught wind of the tensions. They have been heard to
mutter that relocating the statue would be just the thing to “show those
ungrateful Estalians what’s what.”
Who Needs Enemies?: A regiment of Knights of the Blazing Sun are
called to take part in a battle alongside a regiment of Knights of the
White Wolf. The White Wolf captain is particularly disparaging of
Myrmidia and her feminine southern ways. So disdainful is he that,
should the Knights of the Blazing Sun become mired in a punishing
melee, he might just let them get “a bit of a bloody nose” rather than
race to their assistance. The captain of the Knights of the Blazing Sun
will be outraged if he realises other knights behaved in a manner that
resulted in unnecessary casualties.

(Core) Within each knightly order there are those who rise to the top, the best of the best.
They have proven themselves valiant and loyal time and time again and for that
they are brought into the inner circle of the order. They command Knights in the
field, represent the order at court, and make the important decisions. They are
some of the greatest warriors the Old World has to offer and many of them
have been entrusted with dangerous secrets about the foundations of their

The Secret Histories of Knightly Orders
Many knightly orders have a mythology regarding their founding and
the famous (or infamous) deeds that occurred throughout their history.
Knights of the Inner Circle regard it as their responsibility to become
familiar with these tales, and also to keep them secret.
These histories are usually somewhat more fanciful than the official
versions. For example, everyone with any interest in the Order of
the Blazing Sun knows that a pivotal episode in its formation was an
earthquake that caused a statue of Myrmidia to fall upon the Black
Guard of Wasr the Cruel at the Battle of Magritta. Knights of the
Inner Circle, however, are taught that the Order has an older heritage.
Forebears of the Knights fought as a bodyguard to Ottokar, a ruler
in antiquity forgotten by all but classics scholars and playwrights. He
boasted he had met the goddess and she had fallen in love with him.
The stories have it that there was no earthquake during the battle,
but that one of the knightly captains had thrown off his helmet in
a moment of desperation and kissed the foot of the goddess. He
beseeched her for aid, and she promptly toppled over and crushed his
enemies.
Why knightly orders are so secretive about their histories is also a
secret. If an unkind commentator learned of them he might claim that
the reticence was due to the fact that anyone with a serious interest in
history would find these yarns laughable. Still, most knightly orders
persist in handing down such stories.
The Grand Master
The most senior of the Knights of the Inner Circle, and the nominal
heads of each of the knightly orders, are the grand masters. The grand
masters are some of the most well-known military men of the Empire,
admired by the aristocracy (to whom they invariably belong) and
common people alike.
The grand master is expected to be a paragon of knighthood, and
as such must display both great physical prowess and knowledge on
subjects such as history and warfare.
In times of war the grand masters regularly take to the field of battle
alongside their knights, inspiring them with the same sort of awe the
knights themselves inspire in the common soldiery.
Adventure Seeds
Damage Control: Recently a news-sheet has published a rather unkind
account about some of the secrets held to be sacred by the Knights
Panther. The grand master has called an emergency conclave of his most
trusted knights, telling them to make sure the news story is hushed up
and that the source of the leaks is found and made to recant.
Nonsensical Ravings or Divine Inspiration?: The grand master of
the Order of the Fiery Heart is suffering from a grievous wound and
has summoned the Knights of the Inner Circle to his bedside. The man
is raving in a fever, bawling about a vision he saw of Grand Theogonist
Volkmar (who the knights are sworn to protect) standing at the head
of an army of daemons. The Grand Master pronounces that Volkmar
should be disposed of and Arch Lector Esmer made Grand Theogonist
once and for all. Furthermore, he says, the man who kills Volkmar
should be made grand master. He then coughs up a gout of diseased
blood and expires. The Knights are left in confusion, some of them
claiming that the Grand Master was out of his mind, others taking his
final words as a message from Sigmar.

Knight of the Raven
We shall return these abominations to the very earth that spat them out!
(NDM) The Fellowship of the Shroud believes in taking the battle to the enemy. Their
very best warriors form an order known as the Knights of the Raven, and their mandate is
very clear: destroy every Skeleton, Zombie, and Shade upon the earth and exterminate the
necromancers and Vampires who summon them. Unlike their sister order the Black Guard,
the Knights of the Raven are ruthless and aggressive, seeking out their enemy rather than
waiting for Undead to come to them. At the moment, a great many of the knights
are stationed in the town of Siegfriedhof of Stirland on the border of Sylvania. So
far, they have only conducted raids, but as their numbers and intelligence grows,
and the truth about Mannfred’s return becomes undeniable, they will begin a
crusade to take that bleak land away from its dark lords once again.

A Day in the Life
The life of the Knights of the Raven is more arduous than that of a
typical knight. Their camp in Seigfriedhof is far removed from the
comfortable surroundings most knights are used to. The vampiric lords
of Sylvania are aware their enemies are mustering, and they are careful
to keep a close eye on the Knights, instructing their minions to spy on
them and even attack them should the opportunity present itself.
The knights have a reputation of being plagued by accident and
affliction. Whilst many knights suffer injury or even death whilst training
or jousting, such ill fortune seems to strike at the Knights of the Raven
more frequently than most. Hunting parties near Seigfriedhof claim that
they are more likely to encounter a dangerous beast if a Knight of the
Raven rides with them. In the town the knights seem to be involved in
coach accidents or injured in tavern brawls on a regular basis.
The knights know these mishaps are orchestrated by the creatures they
have sworn to destroy. Every time one of their number falls victim to the
ploys of the vampires, they steel themselves with added determination to
wipe their foes from the face of the Old World. Some knights become
impetuous under such circumstances, and after an uncanny spate of
accidents it is not unknown for a group of knights to disappear into
Sylvania to seek vengeance.
Affiliations
The Knights of the Raven are members of the Cult of Morr and have
a great deal of influence with his priests. They are also known to many
members of the Mourners’ Guilds in the towns and cities in the Empire.
The knights are considered senior to the Black Guard who protect sites
sacred to Morr, and some friendly rivalry exists between the two groups.
As experts in fighting the undead the knights are often consulted by
those who face them in battle, either singly or as part of an army.
Vampire hunters and troll slayers might seek their advice on what it is to
face a vampire in single combat, while the generals of armies mustered
to meet an undead threat may consult them on what strategies and
tactics to employ in war.
The knights also search for any lore or advice concerning vampires and
their minions. They may cultivate contacts such as Strigany Mmystics or
Amethyst Magisters to better understand the foe they seek to wipe from
the Old World.
Adventure Seeds
When Opportunity Knocks: A Knight of the Raven has researched
diligently into the lore of the vampires. He has learned of their links
with ancient Khemri. When rumours reach him of a Khemrian tomb
recently discovered in the Borderlands he considers that leaving his post
in Siegfriedhof to investigate further. The knight has little interest in the
treasures rumoured to be found there, but hopes to come across ancient
texts, or copy down hieroglyphics that might shed more light on his
enemies.
No Safe Secrets: The vampires of Sylvania send minions to spy on
their enemies and assail them if possible, and a Knight of the Raven
could attract all sorts of unwanted attention as a result. Bestial minions
might simply attack the knight if an opportunity arises, but more subtle
minions might try to discredit the knight, reporting any illicit activities
he might partake in, or any unsavoury associates he might have to local
agitators or newssheets. Finding and neutralising these spies will become
paramount if the party want to operate with any secrecy or privacy.

Arms and Armour of a Knight of the Realm
The knight wears a mail coat as his main defence, though solid
schynbalds protect the shins and poleyns guard the knees. The elbow is
protected by a simple couter, the disk design used here is primitive even
by the standards of Bretonnian armour and, together with the studded
leather vambraces worn on the forearm, suggests a poor knight. The
coat extends to just above the knees and down the arms where it forms
mail mittens. Beneath the mail is worn a vertically quilted padded coat.
A brigandine is worn over the mail. This is a canvas jacket lined with
plates of metal or whalebone secured by rivets. The helm is attached by
a chain to the mail coif beneath, to prevent loss in battle and, unusually
for a Bretonnian knight, bears no crest. This man does not bear any
aillettes, small shield-shaped bits of parchment or wood bearing his
heraldry. Instead he wears many badges pinned to the ends of his belt or
to the straps attached to the edge of his coif.
The knight carries a sword and a small flanged mace he might employ
in preference against heavily armoured opponents. A boar commonly
appears on the heraldries of knights from Artois in memory of
Morthanok, a dangerous beast slain by a Lord of Artois to make the
centrepiece of a feast for the Companions of Gilles the Uniter.
Accusations Regarding the Anachronistic
Quality of Bretonnian Wargear
Military experts in the Empire often remark on the fact that the
Bretonnians persist in utilising wargear that other armed forces of the
Old World relegated to museums centuries ago. Their armour is (by
varying degrees) cumbersome, expensive, difficult to repair, and slow to
produce in comparison to modern designs.
Many theories are proposed for this. Some remark on Bretonnia’s
isolation from the dwarf holds of the World’s Edge Mountains (whose
help was invaluable in developing the intricate plate armour and
gunpowder weapons famously employed by the Empire’s armies), whilst
others blame it on a complacent attitude that is supposedly intrinsic
to the inhabitants of the kingdom. When pressed on the subject most
Bretonnians are dismissive, claiming piety protects better than steel.
Adventure Seeds
The Bretonnian Way: The Bretonnian King is sending a new
ambassador to Karl Franz’s court in Altdorf, and a group of knights
are to accompany him. The Bretonnian knights are the object of
subtle derision; military men in the Empire find their ways folksy and
bewildering. A tournament is being organised to mark the Emperor’s
birthday, and the Bretonnian knights have vowed to do all they can
to humiliate the Empire knights in the joust. Cheating wouldn’t be
chivalrous, and might even engender an international incident, but then
again national pride is at stake.
A Careless Youth Turned Knight: As a young man, the knight was
slothful and preferred to fish whilst everyone else prayed at the Grail
Chapel. One day he drew forth a strange creature from the Ois, an
eelish thing of surpassing ugliness. He threw it into the village well and
forgot all about it. He later went to Araby as a knight errant for many
years. He returned older and more responsible to claim his late father’s
estate, but found the village in decline. A year ago a huge Dracoleech
slithered from the well. The villagers have learned to sate it by leaving
sheep by its lair in a fast-flowing stretch of the Ois, but keeping it fed
is causing great hardship. They beg the Knight to fix his mistake by
putting the monster to death.

A Most Unusual Knight
The Knights of the Verdant Field bear a closer resemblance to the
foresters accompanying the Empire’s armies than typical knights.
Indeed, members of the other knightly orders have trouble recognising
the Knights of the Verdant Field as peers.
They are trained and equipped in their atypical manner in order to
undertake an effective defence of Talabheim. Manning the Taalbaston
walls, skirmishing in the Taalgrunhaar Forest and street fighting within
Talabheim itself, all require their unorthodox style.
Myrmidian military theorists first tried to task the Knights of the
Blazing Sun with these duties, and while they performed admirably,
the terrain involved did not favour deployment of heavily armoured
horsemen. Instead, the Knights of the Verdant Field were conceived as
a new order of knights trained as archers. The first members were select
Knights of the Blazing Sun with a talent for archery and the humility to
give up their traditional military methods.
The Knights of the Verdant Field have yet to commit to a battlefield in
any great number, but they have proved their worth on many occasions
by seeing off beastman raiding parties that stray close to the Taalbaston.
Notable Figure
Otto Feuerbach is a minor member of one of Talabheim’s most powerful
families. Though distantly related to the missing Elector of Talabheim,
Otto has little time for political intrigue and harbours no ambitions
for an electoral seat. He has had an interest in military matters since
childhood and is a keen archer, having practised as a youth on his
father’s estate near Klarfeld.
Otto witnessed a demonstration of the Knights of the Verdant Field
one summer while he oversaw the manning of a watch tower on the
Taalbaston walls. A marauding band of mutants had snuck in under the
trajectory of the tower’s artillery pieces, and was in the process of scaling
the walls when they were cut down by a flurry of arrows. Otto was sure
that if they had made the ramparts good men would have died. Otto
was even more impressed when he learned that the Knights had been
hidden in positions outside the walls, sitting in hiding mere metres from
the mutants’ position until the perfect moment to launch their attack.
Otto was So impressed he visited the Temple of Myrmidia, sharing his
military insights with the priests there. Otto went on to be inducted
into the Cult of Myrmidia and now fights in the ranks of the Knights of
the Verdant Field.
Adventure Seeds
Covert Training: An enterprising Knight of the Verdant Field is keen
to learn more of elven tactics to further hone his company’s skills.
However, the Knight is reluctant to make his efforts known to his
fellow knights, uncertain how they will respond to seeking aid from the
wood elves. The Knight of the Verdant field decides to secretly sponsor
a group to make contact with the wood elves, offering them gifts or
favours on the knight’s behalf in exchange for knowledge of how best to
operate as an elite skirmishing band of archers.
Reclaiming Honor: Recently the Skaven boiled out of the sewers to
wage war on Talabheim. A young recruit of the Knights of the Verdant
Field deserted his post in panic as the area filled with caustic gas. He
admitted his cowardice to the priests of Myrmidia. They decide he
cannot return to the city unless he bears the head of Ghark Manspitter,
the leader of a band of beastmen who have been raiding farmsteads
surrounding the Taalbaston.

Knight Panther
Why sail to faraway lands for a pelt? We have no shortage of mountain lions right here in the Empire. It would be

Chapter Houses
The Knights Panther are headquartered in a stout fortress built in the
modern style, just a few miles from Carroburg. From here, the Grand
Master Baron Heinrich von Torlichhelm oversees a dozen or more
chapter houses scattered mainly across Reikland and Middenland. The
second largest chapter house is located in Talabheim. Its knights report
to Carroburg as a formality, but they serve under the employ of Countess
Elise Krieglitz-Untern. The third largest Knights Panther chapter house
represents the Graf’s personal bodyguard in Middenheim. The Graf’s
bodyguard is known for its righteous and highly decorated knights.
The banquet halls of Knights Panther chapter houses are adorned with
the helms of its members from generations past. Because the order
dates as far back as the Arabyan crusades of the 15th century, many of
the panther head coverings on these memorial helms have turned to
desiccated leather. Each chapter house also mounts a splendidly crafted
standard behind the head of its banquet table. The order’s magic battle
standard is kept by the Carroburg chapter house, but any chapter may
requisition it for conflicts against powerful Chaos sorcerers. Chapter
houses have scrollwork slogans inscribed in Classical above their
entrances. Typical slogans are short statements like “Regis Pantera”, or
“Pantera Deus”.
Baron Heinrich von Torlichhelm, Grand Master
of the Knights Panther
Baron von Torlichhelm was elected to the position of Grand Master
both for his diplomacy, and for his purity of faith. He has been forced
to mediate countless disputes between his own knights and those of
the White Wolf, for Ulricans have long memories and it was publicly
known that von Torlichhelm’s predecessor was an unwitting pawn
of Chaos. As a result, Knights Panther are frequently accused by the
White Wolves of granting mercy to mutants and cultists, which only
spurs them to greater violence. The Knights Panther’s past indignity
has become something of a private joke among the White Wolfs.
Torlichhelm himself is a devout follower of both Sigmar and Ulric, and
was known before his election as a generous benefactor of both cults.
The most zealous Sigmarites among the Knights Panther believe that
von Torlichhelm was elected purely to appease the Ulricans, which they
regard as disgraceful pandering. Overall, however, von Torlichhelm
has made significant progress mending fences. He encouraged the
Knights Panther to display beastman heads on their helms in place
of the traditional cats, and convinced the Graf to appoint a Midden
Marshal’s son to his Knight Panther honour guard. Von Torlichhelm’s
biggest challenge will be to preserve the Knights Panther’s long-standing
traditions through this period of change.
Adventure Seeds
Beastmen Abound: One of the more conservative chapters has refused
to adopt the new practice of wearing beastman heads, claiming they’re
unclean. A knight from another chapter is sent to persuade them of the
need for unity. Soon after his arrival, they receive news of a beastman
warherd on the move.
The Poor and Wretched: A knight’s chapter is launching attacks
into a forest where hundreds of mutants have taken refuge. On one
expedition, the knight’s unit happens upon a small leper colony.
Half the knights wish to slay the refugees, claiming they can’t risk
overlooking any mutants, whilst the other half would rather show the
lepers mercy. Heated debate ensues.

Lamplighter
There’s no sight more beautiful than the sun rising over the streets of Altdorf… ah… bed time!
(SoA) The Empire’s largest cities have a wonder seen nowhere else in the Old World: the
streetlamp. They are used to illuminate the major streets and thoroughfares, particularly in wealthy
neighbourhoods. Altdorf was the first city to install streetlamps and those surrounding the Emperor’s
Palace are particularly ornate. Lamplighters are responsible for maintaining the streetlamps and
lighting them each night as dusk falls. They carry a variety of candles and matches and some even use
the slow burning matches common to firearms. City dwellers are proud of their streetlamps, seeing
them as symbols of sophistication and civilisation. Such is the threat of fire in the closely packed
buildings that interfering with the lamplighters is punishable by death.
Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Lamplighter for
Burgher with your GM’s permission.

The Lamper’s Tasks
Each district of a city has its own lamplighter, or lamper as he is known.
He begins his daily round at dawn, when he patrols his route, snuffing
out the streetlamp candles using a small hook on the end of the long
pole that is the hallmark of his profession.
He makes a mental note of any candles that need replenishing, or
streetlamps that require repairing, and returns later in the day with a
ladder and the necessary candles or tools to fix the problem. The lamper
is otherwise unengaged during daylight hours, and takes this chance to
catch up on his sleep.
Just before dusk, his tasks begin again, when he relights the streetlamps
under his supervision, using a wick on the other end of his lamper’s
pole. He is expected to patrol the streets to ensure that the lamps remain
lit. On stormy days, he may have to regularly relight candles snuffed out
by a relentless wind. Winter, with its long, cold nights, is a particularly
hard time for lamplighters.
Because of their night-time activity, the watch makes extensive use of
lamplighters as an extra pair of eyes against crime, but this only serves
to make lamplighters a target for the murderous thieves who haunt the
night-time streets.
The Festival of Light
At dusk, during the Autumn and Winter Equinox festivals, lamplighters
undertake a solemn procession through the streets of the Empire’s cities,
bearing lanterns aloft on their poles, decorated with colourful string and
ribbons. They light the wicks of their lanterns using the sacred flame
that burns before the altar of Verena, and are blessed by the temple’s
priests as lightbringers, tasked with the sacred duty of banishing the
darkness of the winter months.
Many townsfolk flock to witness the glittering sight of the lampers’
march, and much revelry follows in its wake. The procession winds its
way through all the major streets of the city, and the lampers light the
streetlamps as they go.
When the march has come full circle, stopping at the gates to Verena’s
temple, onlookers eagerly count the number of wicks still burning. If
no flame has gone out, then the gods have blessed the city with good
fortune in the coming year. If most of the wicks have lost their flame,
the new year promises woe and privation.
Adventure Seeds
Vandalism: Someone is smashing the city’s street lamps. Burglaries
are on the increase in the affected areas, and the authorities assume a
connection. However, although the lamplighters are extra vigilant, no
culprit has yet been found, and the damage continues. Indeed, one
old lamplighter claims to have witnessed a streetlamp shattering of its
own accord before his eyes. The authorities are determined to find the
culprit and quash the growing rumours of poltergeist activity which are
unsettling the townsfolk.
Death of a Lamper: A lamplighter has been found in a pool of his own
blood, his throat cut, murdered while performing his nightly duties. A
high bounty is offered to anyone who can track down the killer.

Lay Priest
The gods cannot possibly answer every plea for aid. Therefore, we must be grateful for the help we are given,
and we must always remain prepared to help ourselves.
(New)Priests who serve their god’s will through worldly deeds are known as lay priests. Unlike their
magical counterparts, lay priests do not labour day and night studying esoteric scriptures to achieve
communion with the divine. Instead, lay priests deliver sermons to common folk, for ultimately the faith
of the masses is what elevates gods above daemons and spirits. Lay priests are not just preachers, however;
they are also tradesmen, scholars and administrators. A god’s sphere of influence is manifested by the
lay priest’s expertise in his field, and the divine ideal is exemplified by his public conduct.

A Day in the Life
In the early morning, priests share insights from their prayers and
discuss spiritual dilemmas over breakfast. Lay priests then open the
temple to visitors and give counsel to supplicants; meanwhile the divine
priests meditate in preparation for morning prayer. After prayers, lay
priests open the temple’s scriptoria, workshops or chapels, where they
labour throughout the morning with the aid of initiates. Initiates may
be instructed to continue work on their own if any crises of faith or
other administrative matters require the lay priest’s attention.
Priests consult with each other during the midday meal and decide
whether divine intervention should be summoned to fix any unresolved
problems. If the ascetic priests’ powers are needed elsewhere, then
lay priests conduct afternoon services at the temple. Otherwise, lay
priests spend the afternoon proselytising among the common folk and
administering temple business. Evening prayers are usually attended by
all the temple’s priests.
From Deeds to Words
Manann: The temples of Manann are staffed by priests who dedicate
their lives to nautical cartography, shipbuilding and marine sciences.
Their sermons ebb and flow in pace, much like the waves themselves.
Morr: Gardens of Morr require stoneworkers, carpenters and
undertakers for burial preparations. Lay priests often perform these
tasks when not writing solemn eulogies or attending funeral rites.
Myrmidia: The armouries at Myrmidian temples are maintained by
expert weaponsmiths, and lay priests advise army generals on strategic
matters. Religious services often resemble military parades.
Ranald: Hidden shrines of Ranald are frequently relocated by the
subterfuge of lay priests, who also seek out prospective cult members.
The holy word of Ranald is a brief whisper of advice from the shadows.
Shallya: Hospices of Shallya employ skilled physician-priests to attend
the sick and injured. Sermons preaching love and compassion are
delivered in gentle, soothing tones to ease the listener’s soul.
Sigmar: Sigmar’s temples are staffed by priests with skill in
statesmanship and diplomacy. Sigmarite lay priests are also historians of
the Empire, and their sermons usually incorporate moral history lessons.
Taal and Rhya: Holy places of Taal and Rhya are tended by priests
who are also hunters, woodsmen, farmers and midwives. They address
their small congregations using expressive, uncomplicated language.
Ulric: The priests of Ulric’s temples are both warriors and politicians.
In the northern Empire, priests are also rugged outdoorsmen who
preach the honourable traditions of the battle god in rural communities.
Verena: Verena’s temples are massive libraries staffed by scribes,
archivists and scholars. Lay Priests often study to become lawyers or
magistrates. Liturgical rites resemble long, formal university lectures.
Adventure Seeds
Trial by Faith: A visiting high priest from the order’s largest temple
is testing the local clergy’s faith. Each priest must undertake an ordeal
to prove his devotion and knowledge of sacred texts. To test the priests’
integrity, the exact requirements of the ordeals are kept secret until
they’re completed. Early on, it becomes evident that the tests are
rigourous enough that the lay priest needs to rely on the assistance of
others to help complete the ordeal.

Litigant
Well, there are fifteen witnesses who say it was you, and the Watch caught you in the act. Other than that,
I don’t think they have a case against you.
(TiT) Litigants are common sights both in Talabheim and all the major cities of the Old World. They
write up legal documents, interpret the law, and represent individuals in court who are able to afford their
fees. Litigants are almost universally reviled, except when someone is in legal trouble and needs assistance.
Litigants need to be well versed in both the laws of the Empire and the region they plan to practice law,
plus have a great deal of knowledge about day-to-day affairs. Even the lowest-born litigant is considered
a “person of letters” to the general populace and may be asked to do things far beyond their training.

Affiliations
Litigants make it their business to know all kinds of professionals, from
scribes and scholars to tradesmen and skilled labourers, to merchants,
politicians, burghers and even a noble or two.
Successful litigants have a wide network of associates upon whom they
rely for advice and services. Litigants frequently employ messengers or
coachmen to carry summonses, bills, payments or contracts across town
while they themselves are occupied with other matters.
On rare occasions, it may profit a litigant to employ the services of a
bounty hunter, or some other person of an unsavoury nature, in the
successful pursuit of a case, or to help obtain evidence which may
exonerate a client.
Little Known Facts
Litigants represent nobles and wealthy private personages before a
magistrate in court.They have spent years learning the laws of the
Empire and the local customs particular to the region they are practising
in and are adept at reading moods and spinning convincing arguments
in favour of their clients.
Hiring a litigant is far from cheap, and the vast majority of people in the
Empire can’t afford to do so. However, the rich will gladly pay a skilled
litigant to help them avoid the unpleasantness of prison. As a result,
litigants are hated by the common classes, and are the popular butt of
many sneering, bawdy jokes.
Litigants not only need to be experts on the law, they also need to be
familiar with the magistrates before whom they must argue their client’s
cases. Cultivating a modest acquaintance with a magistrate can make
all the different when presenting a case. Knowing which palms can
and cannot be successfully greased can also have a striking effect on the
outcome of a trial.
Travelling litigants tend to be even more rare than travelling magistrates;
for one thing, litigants rely heavily on their network of experts to help
them, and these tend to be most easily accessed from a fixed location.
This means that only the larger cities and towns will have litigants’
services available.
Adventure Seeds
The Dangers of Litigation: A person of high standing is on trial.
Many powerful enemies are arrayed against him: rival lords, wealthy
merchants, even high priests. The characters are hired by the accused
to guard his litigant, protecting him from the skulduggery of his
opponents. If the litigant is intimidated, seriously injured or otherwise
unable to continue presenting the case, the condemned will surely be
found guilty, and his relatives may revenge themselves on those who
failed to protect his lawyer.
Not as it Seems: A litigant is being paid to defend a wealthy merchant
accused of murdering his mistress. The case seems pretty clear-cut. The
accused awoke in bed with the murdered woman, a bloody knife in his
hand. However, the litigant is an old friend of the merchant, and does
not believe he can be responsible for the crime. He hires the characters
to investigate the murder, and they unravel a plot that threatens to
destabilise the higher reaches of Imperial society.

Man at Arms
You shall fight at his Lordship’s command and his whim. You shall be better than you were, for you wield and wear the arms
of his Excellency! And you shall die, if that sacrifice be demanded of you, but you die well for the cause of our Lord.
(KotG) Whilst knights are the backbone of Bretonnian armies,
peasants form the bulk. Some receive no training at all and are simply
rounded up and pointed at the enemy. Men-at-Arms are the lucky ones.
When they were paraded before their lord, he decided they had the potential
to fight back and ordered that they be trained.
Still, the training and equipment that Men-at-Arms receive are not very good, and whilst they do
receive some pay, it is far less than you might expect for risking your life. Most important, they are
given no choice in the matter. As a result, it is not uncommon for Men-at-Arms to seize any chance to
desert, and many deserters take up a life of adventure.

Kharmourt’s Blades
These elite troops are the personal pride of Baron Larieu of Kharmourt,
an adjutant of the Duke of Carcassonne. While other Bretonnian
barons might field poorly-trained or under-equipped men-at-arms, his
officers train two detachments of greatswordsmen in tabards of black
and green – the baron’s colors. Those worthies promoted to sergeants
are presented with mail coats, while the two commanding veterans
proudly wear their lord’s raven and toad on their breastplates. All of
them brandish greatswords and know how to wield them in close ranks,
never losing ground due to disorder or injury to one’s fellows. (Many of
Sir Larieu’s fellow nobles try and fail to lure away some of his officers,
hoping to train their men-at-arms to such magnificent discipline.)
Walking Away
“I’m tired, Vaorn. Can’t we stop a while and rest? Or at least find some
food?”
“Shut it, Artor!” Vaorn whispered over his shoulder. “Do ye want to
draw his lordship’s hunters or no? We’ll be hanged at best, if’n we’re
caught! Now step where I be once I move…”
The drizzle dampened Artor’s leathers and the bog into which he and
Vaorn had fled kept soaking over the top of his boots. He kept having
to steady himself with his halberd like a staff as they moved through the
bog. He hoped he’d not have to use the weapon soon, slimy as it was.
Vaorn had always thought for both of them, even when they were kids.
He told him they’d been picked to join his lordship’s army, not saying
until later which lordship. Artor went along anyway, happy at first for
more regular meals and drink than they ever got as stable hands. They
got leathers and smart uniforms, and trained to fight with a halberd.
His lordship, the knight Sir Jhollas, promised them land to call their
own, land they needed to earn by fighting for him. `Course, they didn’t
learn they were to reclaim part of cursed Mousillon from the Baron
Perryol, until they were marching along the Grismerie.
After two months battling against the poxed and press-ganged forces of
the baron, Vaorn was the one to whisper “Pox on this. I’m running...”
as they gnawed that night’s maggoty biscuit soaked in a cold stew more
dog than deer. As always, Artor followed his brother’s lead, which
brought them to this cold, fetid bog.
Vaorn moved into a patch of reeds, slipped, and splashed into a
deep pool, swearing as he fell. He half-rose out of the dark water but
lurched forward again before he could fully stand up. The burly man
disappeared beneath the surface, the reeds shaking as he fought beneath
the fetid water.
Artor whispered, “Vaorn?” before the arm clamped onto his left leg, the
putrescent black-green flesh only covering two of five fingers and part
of the forearm. Maybe life as his lordship’s Man at Arms weren’t so bad as
this…

Marauder
Blood! Death! Blood! Death!
(ToC) Most Norsemen are great warriors, blessed with strength at arms and fierce
demeanours, but it is the dream of nearly every Norsemen to join the ranks
of the greatest warriors, to become Champions of Chaos and bear the marks
of their Gods’ favour. Until they can prove their value to the Dark Gods, they
are simply Marauders. Most Marauders are the core of the Chaos Hordes. They
flock to the banners of their Champions, throwing their weight behind any cause,
whether it’s the bidding of their Gods or the call to battle. When not part of a great
army, they spend their time raiding villages of the Empire (Cathay, for Hung Marauders). Natural
fighters, they are hardened by the bleak land and bred for battle. They hold all others in contempt.
Note: The Marauder career is open to Norsemen, Kurgan, and Hung. The latter two are generally
horsemen, hence this career allows for Marauders that serve as horsemen. For details on these peoples,

A Day in the Life
A marauder lives solely to become a champion of chaos. He knows that
many are called, and most die on the way – but that won’t happen to
him. The belief that he will be one of the few elite, one anointed by
Chaos, drives him in every way. There is no doubt possible.
To that end, he exults in death and destruction, as bloody and
purposeless as possible. Raids are executed with raw, overwhelming
force, not cunning and planning. In the raw, red, fury of battle, there is
nothing but the whirling of blades and the pure joy of feeling a fallen
foe’s heart blood spray across your face. After the fight is done, there
is time for a breather, a chance to slay the survivors in gory games of
torture and death.
After that... the marauder packs up and moves on, pausing only to
occasionally drink and squander his pelf. Eventually, the call will come
to join a warband of Chaos, and this is where the marauder can truly
show all he has learned on his raids, battling alongside and beastmen as
he strives to outperform them in acts of debauched, violent, savagery.
It’s a good life.
Affiliations
No matter how skilled he may be, the marauder cannot last long on
his own. One marauder is simply a heavily armed madman running
loose in a town – he may bring down five or even ten opponents on his
own, but he will soon be overwhelmed and slain. Even worse, he may
be taken prisoner and forced to die by hanging, not by the blade. So he
relies on his band.
A Marauder band is constantly torn by savage violence and bloody
fights over the most trivial of causes, or no cause at all. It takes a leader
of almost supernatural charisma to hold one together for long.
Bands regularly splinter into new bands, or sometimes merge with
others. It is possible, though rare, for some friendships to form among
pairs or very small groups of three or four, and these bonds of shieldbrothers
will stick together as the larger band divides or grows.
Adventure Seeds
The Lesser Evil: The peaceful fishing village has realized that a band
of marauders is moving along the coast, and that they are but a few
days from slaughter. They seek out the party to provide protection
and training, but can offer little in exchange except for rude shelter,
dried fish, and some measure of gratitude. It is possible, however, that
there could be all manner of heretical cults which have secretly infested
the village, and the party may merely be keeping overt Chaos from
destroying covert Chaos.
The Right Tool for the Job: Someone needs to die – badly. However,
the party doesn’t think they’re up to the job. A marauder warband is
nearby, but they’re heading in the wrong direction. If, somehow, the
party could divert them to wash over their own target, the slaughter
could be accomplished with a minimum of fuss and bother. Of course,
controlling a warband is not easy. Infiltration, attack, or trickery might
all be used. Parties of Norse descent will have an easier time of it, and if
one of their number is a marauder, so much the better!

Marine
So, they think they can just waltz over here and plunder our hold? Let’s show ‘em wot’s wot, boys!
(Core) Marines are ship-borne soldiers who can be found in the Imperial fleet and onboard
the larger private vessels. They protect their ships from pirates, Norse marauders, and other
raiders. Unlike seamen, whose primary duty is sailing the ship, Marines are onboard only
to fight. When in port, Marines frequently form press gangs to fill out the ship’s crew. More
than one unsuspecting citizen has awoken at sea after taking a belaying pin to the head from
an overzealous press ganger. Due to these activities, and their own drunken brawling, Marines
are resented in many seaside communities. When raiders attack, however, these same citizens are
quick to accept the aid of battle-hardened Marines.
Note: During character creation, if you take Common Knowledge (the Wasteland), your character
can be from the great port of Marienburg at your option.

Blackjack Bernhardt
In the coastal village of Brackwater, sea captains with crews to fill turn to
Blackjack Burnhardt first. The legendary press-ganger owns the largest
boarding-house in town, and has no compunction about drugging and
selling his guests.
One late evening, Burnhardt found himself with an urgent order from
a desperate captain for a hundred crewmen and little time to spare.
Unfortunately for Blackjack, there were very few ships in port at the time
and the boarding-house was empty. This meant that the ever-resourceful
marine would have to quickly formulate one of his famous cunning
plans.
The first step of Blackjack’s plot was to charter an old river barge called
the Fortuna. Next, Blackjack put out the word that he had inherited
a large sum of money, and invited everyone aboard the Fortuna to
celebrate his windfall with free mutton and ale. One hundred and twenty
men showed up, and the Fortuna put to sea amid much drinking and
feasting. Of course the ale was drugged, and Blackjack sailed the Fortuna
to a secret cove where the captain awaited his new “crewmen”.
Now Blackjack faced a new problem. The whole village of Brackwater
had seen the Fortuna sail off with a shipload of drunken revellers. He
and his marine brethren were already disliked by many in town who
resented their work as press-gangers. Any misstep now could fan the
flames of resentment and Blackjack would be run out of town or worse.
How was he going to explain the empty barge when it returned to port?
Just as Blackjack resolved to move on and find a new village to haunt, he
came upon an Estalian merchant ship run aground. The marine knew
good fortune (or Fortuna) when he found it, and sailed the grateful crew
home to Brackwater under the noses of his oblivious neighbours.
Boarding Actions
It is a standard business in the Empire for the Imperial fleet and other
wealthy private merchants to pay lucrative bounties for captured enemy
ships and cargoes. Since the value of an intact ship is considerably greater
than that of a towed wreck, tactics had to be devised to allow the seizing
of an enemy vessel without destroying it. Collectively these tactics are
known as boarding actions.
The boarding action is generally considered the most hazardous venture
in any naval engagement. Pirates and privateers live and die by the
boarding action as they are only paid for the capture of intact ships
and cargoes. In the case of Imperial or merchant fleets, it falls upon the
marine to coordinate and carry out boarding actions.
There are two accepted ways of mounting a ship-to-ship boarding action
and both are extremely dangerous. The first option is to steer the two
ships close enough together for the boarding party to leap across to the
enemy deck. The second and less attractive option is for the boarding
party to actually row across to the enemy vessel and board it using
grappling hooks and rope. Boarding actions also serve a military purpose
by dealing a killing blow to crippled ships that might otherwise continue
to fight. Important intelligence or prisoners may also be gained before
the ship is sent to the bottom.

Dishonourably Discharged: Waterfront has it that a former Imperial

his home. He must perform the many tasks required of a senior and
respected member of his community, tasks which sometimes take him
away from his work for hours, days or more.
A good portion of his skill is not just in carving runes; it is also in
carving up his time, making sure that everyone gets what they need of
him and no more. Given all this, though, it is not surprising that some
masters will set off for a time – sometimes a long time – in search of
knowledge. These “adventuring masters” are often near-legends, as they
will explore the most dangerous places, such as ancient dwarf holds now
overrun by the orcs, in their pursuit of forgotten lore.
Little Known Facts
About once per generation, a call will go out to all of the dwarf holds
and settlements announcing a Grand Conclave. This occurs during a
rare period of low intensity warfare – there is no such thing as peace,
but some years are calmer than others.
The conclaves, which take a year to fully plan out, call together large
numbers of masters and a handful of very select journeymen and
apprentices to a month long gathering where knowledge is shared, old
debts are settled and the various other duties and distractions which
occupy the masters can be set aside. Such conclaves are, obviously,
arranged with great secrecy; none but the invited know of them. If the
enemies of the dwarfs found out about one, and attacked with sufficient
force, it could be devastating.
It is rumoured that master runesmiths have learned to tie the braids of
their beards into runic patterns, making them impervious to harm. Few
dare attempt to prove this, but “stonebeard” is a common nickname for
a master runesmith.
Adventure Seeds
Out And About: For as long as anyone can remember, Grundi
Urgrimson has been the rock around which his hold has been built. To
not see him walking from his home to his workshop at the same time
every morning, or see him attending to his apprentices in the evening,
would indicate that the world has gone out of balance. Now, however,
he has decided it is time to go out into the world, though he will not say
what he is seeking. He does say that he seeks worthy companions, and
now, all of the young and adventurous are desperate to prove themselves
to him and be chosen.
Fit For A King: A master runesmith has travelled to a nearby human
city, and has made a grand announcement: he will create an item of
tremendous power for whoever does “the greatest service to the dwarfish
people.” Naturally, this has attracted a lot of attention, as well as a lot of
debate over what to do. Some are rushing out to collect as many orc ears
as they can, while others think the master might be looking for a more
subtle form of service. It’s obvious from some of his cryptic statements
that he has something in mind, but what is it?
Master Runesmith
Pay attention. I am not going to repeat myself.
(RoS) Master Runesmiths are the teachers and keepers Rune knowledge. Very few
Runesmiths ever rise to this status and of those who do, many stay within their holds,
passing on what they have learned to the young and talented Dwarfs in their families.
Other Master Runesmiths devote years of their lives to the search for ancient secrets,
exploring the world to uncover ancient weapons and artefacts of great age, hoping
to recover lost Runes of ancient and fabled Runesmiths. Such quests take Master
Runesmiths into dangerous places, such as ruined holds, dragon lairs, the depths of
Elven forests, and worse, for much of the Dwarfs territory has, over the centuries,
fallen into the hands of their enemies.
Note: Only Dwarfs can enter this career.

Master Thief
Nothing is ever truly safe. If someone wants it badly enough, they can find... ways... to obtain it.
(Core) In every profession there are those who rise to the top. Master Thieves are the grand
artistes of the criminal world. They are the best Thieves there are, proficient in all the skills that
it takes to illegally acquire the goods of others. Master Thieves are usually a part of the local
Thieves’ Guild structure, but as bravos who regularly flout the law, many of them are content
to operate, ironically enough, “illegally”, e.g. without the approval of the local Crime Lord. The
Empire has a long tradition of secretly admiring bold Thieves, though they will still be punished if caught.

A Day in the Life
Master thieves spend more time preparing their capers than actually
committing crimes. Their crimes require far more caution and precision
than a standard purse-snatching or breaking and entering. Master
thieves only go after items of extreme value, and those items are always
guarded according to their worth.
Few city inhabitants can claim to know the streets and alleys as well as a
master thief. Intimate knowledge of potential escape routes, shortcuts,
hidey-holes, and vantage points can mean the difference between
success and failure, and regular tours of the city help reassure him
that if something has changed, it will not surprise him at the wrong
moment. Seeking new information, typically at taverns or in the town
marketplace is also a daily ritual – a good master thief needs to always
be aware of new job opportunities.
When he has a specific target in mind, the master thief observes the
subject and the surrounding closely. He examines the place the item
is kept, without arousing suspicion. He studies the owners or keepers,
because understanding them means being able to predict what methods
they will use to safeguard the item. He marks those tasked to protect the
item, and considers every possible route to avoid them. It can be days or
even weeks before the master thief is ready to finalize his plans.
During all this time the master thief avoids attention. He does not steal
anything else, both because it would be beneath his skills and because if
he did get caught it would ruin his plans. He does not start fights. He
does not brag about his exploits. He watches and waits. And then, when
everything is in place, he acts, moving quickly and decisively. If all goes
well he is back in a safehouse with the item before anyone even knows
it is missing.
Little Known Facts
Many of the best master thieves can attribute their success to their
completely unremarkable appearances. Passing as merchants, labourers,
craftsmen, and peasants makes performing their real work all the easier.
Master thieves generally hate to do anything with haste. They prefer to
take their time, examine their options, put together a plan, and execute
that plan without error. This doesn’t mean they can’t and won’t take
advantage of sudden opportunities, but master thieves prefer planning
to improvisation.
A good master thief has at least two cover identities, one safehouse, and
three hidey-holes ready at all times.
In any given city the master thieves know and respect one another.
Most will not cross another’s scheme, which means the first master thief
to claim a target gets to go after it unopposed. His peers will not make
an attempt unless he tries and fails.
Adventure Seeds
Stealing from a Thief: Someone has stolen a valuable emerald brooch
– one the master thief had been planning to steal the next night! Who
would dare take a prize he had already claimed? And who has the skills
to remove it so deftly?
Hands Off: The local crime lord contacts a master thief with a
proposition. Someone has asked the crime lord to acquire a certain
item. He wants the master thief to handle the theft, and promises they
will split the money being paid for this service. He won’t comment on
the nature of the item, only that it is a rare and precious relic, and must
not be touched with bare skin.

Master Vigilant
Vigilant Agents
A master vigilant rarely operates openly. To maintain his secrecy, he
uses cells of trusted minions, and goes to great lengths to preserve his
identity even from them. Some masters appear to their agents masked,
other prefer to correspond with letters written in cryptic code. All
maintain an alias.
Some agents are chosen because they possess skills useful in the pursuit
of rogue wizards or vampires, others because their social class allows
them to infiltrate where most cannot enter. All share one thing in
common: their hatred of the enemies of the Empire, which binds them
to their master.
Agents never suspect that they are working for a representative of the
Orders of Magic. Many distrust the Orders as much as they despise
followers of Chaos or the undead. Those that give a damn suspect that
they are working for a clandestine arm of Imperial government. Most
are content that their work rids the world of abominations, and do not
feel the need to question their master’s motives.
Hammer of the Witches
The curse of the master vigilant is that all his deeds must go unsung.
Even among his own kind, the wizards of the Magic Orders, he must
remain unknown. Only his immediate superior and the magister lord of
his Order know his identity.
Thus it is that the world will never hear of Magister Bane, the most
successful master vigilant of recent history. It was he who consigned
to flames the tower of Magister Leidenschaft deep in the Forest of
Shadows, burning the wizard on a pyre of his forbidden parchments,
a fitting end for one who parleyed with daemons. It was he who
uncovered the Distaff Plot, which threatened the life of the Emperor
during a diplomatic voyage to Bretonnia shortly after his accession.
A hag-raised storm would have swamped the Imperial fleet were it
not for the intervention of the common folk Bane had roused against
the witches. The master vigilant took great delight in beheading the
instigator of the plot, Countess Merelda van Oust, in the boudoir of her
Marienburg mansion. His silver stake reduced the vampiress to ashes.
What does Bane look like? What is his real name? Nobody knows. But
without him, a dangerous world would be more perilous still.
Adventure Seeds
An Errant Magister: The failure of a high-ranking wizard to attend
a magisterial conclave has led to a search of his house, which reveals
that he has been studying proscribed treatises on daemonology. In the
months before the mage’s disappearance, he had laid off all his servants,
and lived as a virtual recluse. The Magister Patriarch is desperate to find
him, and employs a master vigilant to do so. Unfortunately, one of the
wizard’s servants has informed a witch-hunter of his suspicions about
his former master, and it is a race against time to eradicate the errant
magister before the witch-hunter finds him and brings public shame to
the Orders of Magic.
The Grey Lady: A master vigilant, Waltho Bergen, has been pursuing
the identity of the Grey Lady, an apparition that intermittently plagues
the streets of Wurtbad, capital of Stirland. She is no ordinary ghost,
however, for her manifestation heralds the disappearance of young
children throughout the town. The vigilant believes that the Grey Lady
is a vampire, and suspects the Baroness Amelinde von Schwefel, a highly
regarded socialite. Bergen employs adventurers to infiltrate one of her
renowned parties and discover evidence that will damn her.
Master Vigilant
The time for contrition has passed, Magister Festus. Now is the judgement.
(NDM) The Colleges of Magic are loath to leave their dirty laundry to be washed
in public by the Witch Hunters or other authorities. Consequently, each Order
employs its own watchdogs and investigators, devoted to discretely exposing those
who break their oaths and practice dark magic, necromancy, or diabolism. Since
Vampires are so often students of these black arts, these observers also take pride
in hunting and destroying the princes of darkness. Magisters vigilant still pay their
dues to their College, as per a magister lord, but they are not expected to take
apprentices. Their duties across the Empire prevent them from attaining the control
of magic that many of their colleagues possess, but they have many other skills and
talents useful in other sorts of situations, and they command great respect and fear
amongst their own kind.
Special Requirement: Characters with the Dark Magic Talent or any Dark Lore
cannot enter this career; the magisters will not allow it and can usually tell. Usually.

Master Wizard
The Winds of Magic are not to be trifled with. I have learned to respect them, and that was the key to
unlocking their power.
(Core) A Master Wizard is one who wields magic with surety and finesse. Elf Wizards find this level of spell
casting easy to attain, but for a Human, it is a life’s work. By the time they reach this level of mastery, most
Wizards begin to exhibit eccentricities and physical changes wrought by close association with magic. Master
Wizards usually prefer to spend their time researching or politicking with fellow magisters. However, their
Order usually requires them to adventure in the world at large, furthering the cause of their art, and seeking
out young folk to apprentice.
Note: If you are Human you must continue to pay dues to your Order for the duration of this
career. Most colleges charge Master Wizards a reduced rate of one crown in every twenty. Elves do
not belong to the Orders of Magic, and thus owe nothing.

The Call to Power
While the motives and backgrounds of master wizards are as varied as
the nature of magic itself, they do share a constant goal – the pursuit of
knowledge and power. A master wizard is driven constantly by a thirst
to discover the secrets of creation. This undeniable compulsion is not in
itself evil. However it is a constant call to power that all who tread the
path of the wizard experience. By the time a person has advanced to the
rank of master wizard this hunger for knowledge and power has become
a siren song within their heads, driving them ever onward.
Wizardly Quirks
The effects of long term exposure to magic can make subtle changes to
a man as his power grows. Players can use the following table to add a
wizardly quirk to their characters if they like (or with the permission
of the GM make up their own). Wizardly quirks should be acquired as
soon as the character takes the Master Wizard career. Note that Elves
never gain wizardly quirks.
1. Unnatural Heat: Your hands and skin are hot to the touch as if you
had a fever. Though others may warm themselves by your flesh, you
gain no benefit from this unnatural heat.
2. Through the Looking Glass: Your reflection is slightly out of sync
with you, lingering for a moment after you turn away from mirrors or
other reflective surfaces.
3. Spectral Voices: You constantly hear whispered voices in your head,
though you can never quite make out what they say. However, you can
occasionally catch a word or two like kill and kitten.
4. Feline Affinity: Cats are your friends and flock to you wherever
you are. Whenever you stand still the cats, and especially the mangy
ones, like to rub themselves against your legs.
5. The Slow Rot: Cloth slowly rots while touching your skin. Over a
few days clothes will moulder and being to disintegrate forcing you to
consider wearing garments of metal or bone.
6. Wizened Claws: Your fingernails and toenails constantly grow and
must be clipped daily lest they become a tangled mess. Wearing gloves
is difficult.
7. Icy Breath: Your breath is cold like an icy breeze and leaves a thin
layer of frost on glass and metal. Those talking to you face to face often
shiver.
8. Light Sleeper: When asleep, you hover a few inches above the
ground. However, when you wake you come crashing down.
9. Stale Touch: Beer goes flat and wine sours in your presence. Taverns
are best avoided, as are breweries and vineyards.
10. Ghostly Breeze: Your hair and clothes are constantly ruffled by an
invisible breeze that nobody else notices. This can make you feel either
heroic or annoyed, depending on your mood.
Adventure Seeds
Old Bones: It is said that the bones of wizards make the best wands,
as they are infused with great magical power. Since most living wizards
protest to people purloining their bones, this has led to some unpleasant
robberies of wizard tombs. This is a practice the colleges would very
much like stopped.

Mister Garbach is the man you want to see. Captain Soarsteiger may own the Nettle’s Sting, but nothing

(Core) Mates serve on ships as the second in command, answering directly to the Captain of the
vessel. They are responsible for ensuring that the Captain’s orders are carried out, which can be a
trying task with even the most professional of crews. Mates have to be stern but fair, earning the
respect of their crew or they will swiftly find themselves the butt of many practical jokes and far
worse if a mutiny should occur. Mates are always experienced sailors, often with several voyages under
their belt and there are few ports they haven’t drank, fought, or caroused in.

Tasks of the Mate
The “true” captain of a vessel in many a sailor’s eyes, the mate often has
a broader grasp of the ship’s operations than a sea captain. To do his job
effectively, he needs to have a thorough knowledge of the ship’s layout,
cargo arrangements, provision stores, weapon stores and crew berths. He
is also in charge of doling out the crew’s pay after a successful voyage.
The mate is the captain’s go-between with the crew, so the mate needs to
be well-acquainted with every man onboard the ship. The mate must be
able to provide the captain with immediate information concerning the
ship at all times. However, he does not hold the same authority as the
captain, so is not always in the loop as to the ship’s course or the true
purpose behind each voyage. However, a proficient mate is as vital to
the success of a voyage as sails, rudder and anchor.
Aldar Morninstone
Aldar is the mate of the Blade Maiden, a heavily tattooed dwarf; one
of the rare breed who has mastered his sea-legs. He was awarded the
position of mate by the Captain, Otto Murgrom, after quelling a
mutiny several years ago. Since that time, the captain has suffered
numerous personal tragedies and business setbacks.
Where he once had a family and a fleet of ships, all he has left is his
ship, his friendship with Aldar and an all-consuming love of drink. Over
the past four years, Aldar has taken on more and more responsibility
and become the captain in all but name on this ship. Now Captain
Otto lives aboard ship but spends much of his time in his quarters in a
haze of self-pity and wine.
The crew of the Blade Maiden have come to accept Aldar as their de
facto leader, and afford him the respect of a dwarf twice his height
(partly out of fear of his temper and his vicious uppercut).
In a rare long shore leave at Marienburg, Aldar met and fell in love with
the purple-eyed Karin Dellardar more than a year ago. Profits grew from
his relationship with her, as she made him part of the nigh-fictional
“Tagranden Merchant Consortium.” Karin fenced stolen goods through
Aldar, which he quietly sold independently of any other cargoes the
Blade Maiden took to Tilean or Bretonnian ports (or beyond).
While previously a law-abiding dwarf, Aldar enjoys the excitement and
slight danger Karin brings to his life. He only hopes he can build up his
own personal fortune and make enough money that he might buy the
Blade Maiden from Murgom sooner than later.

Mediator
Gentlemen, please. I am sure we can come to a mutual understanding.
(KotG) The peasants of Bretonnia try to live their lives without noble interference. When the nobility
get involved, people are beaten or hanged and food is taken, only making matters worse. However, the
peasantry are far from living in a cooperative idyll, and disputes do arise between villages.
Mediators are the peasants chosen to resolve those disputes. They live in one village and deal with the
representatives, normally other Mediators, of villages with which they have a dispute. Mediators do
not normally have the authority to make decisions, so they must try for a solution they can sell to their
neighbours.
Most Mediators are officially herders, as this gives them an excuse to be in odd places if the nobility
find them. Whilst the overwhelming majority are men, a few female Mediators do exist.

Making a Mediation
A mediator’s life is one of careful balance within his community as he
tries to settle disputes without becoming embroiled in them. Most
of the time, a mediator is reliant on the kindness of others within his
village who recognise the good service he is providing. Sometimes
particularly fair and well-known mediators will receive gifts from people
that they have treated well in the past, though wise mediators are careful
about accepting such presents lest they damage their reputation of
impartiality. When a dispute arises, the mediator is immediately called.
In principal, a mediator is summoned as a last resort if the two parties
cannot settle their own differences. However, in practise he finds himself
adjudicating over all manner of petty squabbles, from how small a pig
needs to be to count as a piglet, to a farmer’s right to harvest cow muck
left on his land by the cattle of passing drovers. When the mediator
arrives at the dispute, he quickly assesses the situation.
The appearance of impartiality is as important as impartiality itself,
and even if the mediator has already made his decision upon arrival,
something that often happens as one party is usually clearly in the
wrong, he takes his time and listens carefully, nodding appropriately
and giving sagely looks. He then makes his judgement and goes quickly
on his way. With his job done, he is not bound to actually enforce the
decision, though his fellow villagers will mostly abide by it. Of course,
it pays to not be around if things do turn ugly.
The Art of Mediation
If the best mediators are to be believed, the trick to settling an
argument, whether it is over the price of goose eggs or how high
a farmer can build his fence, is to make sure that neither side is
completely happy with the outcome. Only then can you know that
it has been fair. Perhaps the well known Mousillon mediator, Mother
Grog, put it best when she said “If a man wants a pig then give him a
chicken.” Of course this rule doesn’t seem to apply at all when dealing
with nobility.
Instead it is replaced with a different maxim – if the lord is happy, then
it is the right course of action. For instance, if the lord reserves the right
to hunt peasants that stray into his woods and a mediator is called in
to settle a grievance for the loss of limbs then it is clearly the foolish
peasants’ fault and they should be punished appropriately…my lord.

stalwart fellows to contact the offending village’s mediator and sort it
all out.

Mercenary
I could happily live several lifetimes without quashing another peasant revolt. Unless, of course, the revolt pays
good coin. Ale doesn’t buy itself, you know.
(Core) War never ends in the Old World and that means there is always need for fighting men. While
the Empire does maintain a standing army, its strength is bolstered with Mercenaries. Nobles and rich
Merchants also hire such fighters to protect their interests, many having what amounts to private armies.
Mercenaries range from wild youths with a taste for adventure to grizzled professional soldiers who’ve
seen a dozen battles or more. These sell-swords come from all over, though Tilea is particular famed for its
regiments. All Mercenaries dream of untold riches; for most of them, the reality is an early death and an
unmarked grave.
Note: During character creation, if you take Common Knowledge (Tilea) and Speak Language (Tilean),
your character can be from Tilea at your option.

Merchant
Those bolts of exotic Cathay silks? Pfft. Who’d want those? I’ll give you fifty gold crowns for the entire cartload
because I feel sorry for you. I’m doing you a favour.
(Core) Merchants are speculators who arrange to move large amounts of goods from city to city,
seeking the market that they will make the most handsome profit in. They seldom interact with the
populace as they deal in bulk, generally selling their goods to Burghers and Tradesmen. Merchant
Guilds are extremely influential in the Empire and they are slowly usurping the position once held
by Nobles in the Old World. Even the poorest Merchant tends to be very wealthy, indeed, many use
their wealth to buy legitimacy, purchasing titles or marrying their children into Noble families.

A Day in the Life
To be a merchant is to know the value of a gold coin and a silver
tongue. They know what flows in and out of the gates of a city better
than any soldier or guard. They know how to speak eloquently with
nobility, and conduct the most vulgar of conversations with criminals.
The gift of words is a merchant’s most valuable asset.
For one beginning in the merchant’s trade, much time is spent traveling.
A good merchant knows the path that goods must make from beginning
to end, and a very good merchant knows all the people along that path.
Merchants spend much time in their early years meeting people, and
getting to know who may prove to be allies or hindrances.
As time goes on and the merchant’s coffers begin to fill with gold,
less time is spent in travel, and more is spent in whatever city or port
becomes the center of the merchant’s business. Such time, however, is
not idle. With the knowledge gained in traveling, merchants learn to
better negotiate with ship’s captains and caravan leaders for favorable
transportation costs, and with various guilds for the numerous goods
and services that they need.
A merchant’s evening is usually spent in the company of others,
preferably of those with influence. For the merchant, this is as much
about appearances as it is the opportunity to make allies. Lowly
merchants seen sipping wine with a powerful countess may find
themselves shortly doing business with genteel clients, even if they
never speak a word to the noblewoman. Likewise, a few rolls of the dice
with a notorious criminal in a gambling hall may lessen the number
of bandit attacks on a merchant’s caravan routes…particularly if the
merchant is a gracious loser.
The life of a merchant is one of constant motion. If merchants are not
busy working on a venture, then they are certainly planning the next
one, or at least laying the groundwork for a new opportunity.
Affiliations
Most towns and cities have merchants’ guilds, to which most credible
merchants belong if they wish to be successful. The size and scope of
such guilds is dependent on the size of the town in which they reside.
A small town might only have a single guild encompassing all sorts of
trade, while a large city might have several guilds dealing with more
specific goods, such as foods, cloth, or precious gemstones.
More savvy merchants also are in good standing with related guilds,
such as the shipmaster’s guild or even the thieves’ guild. The extent of
this relationship with other guilds ranges from actual membership, to
some casual friendships and a few well-placed gold coins.
Adventure Seeds
A Golden Opportunity: Raids on merchant caravans by orc tribes
have brought an isolated town to a standstill. Opportunity exists to
make a handsome amount of gold, should a merchant be able to brave
the bandit attacks and reach the town with a full caravan of wagons.
The only question is how to deal with the orcs – to defeat them in
glorious battle, or perhaps make them partners instead?
The Stone Rose: Dwarfs find a vein of rubies in a deep cavern, which
they begin to mine. However, the Dwarfs distrust the nearby human
settlements, and refuse to trade with them. The merchant learns,
though, that the Dwarfs seek an ancient carved stone rose from a nearby
ruin, which they have been unable to find. Whoever finds this for the
Dwarfs might also find a caravan wagon full of rubies.

(Core) With great distances separating the important cities and castles of the Empire,
Messengers are an indispensable means of communication. Nobles, Merchants, and
military commanders all make extensive use of Messengers, mounted if possible. These brave
riders dare to ride the roads of the Empire alone, trusting in their speed to avoid
danger. Roadwardens assist official Messengers as much as possible, but there
are long, lonely stretches where no help is available. While they are supposed
to be immune from harassment, many a Messenger has met a bloody end after
delivering a particularly unpleasant missive.

The Messengers’ Guild
In the early days of the Empire, before the elaborate highway and canal
system were built, the butcher was one of the most travelled tradesmen
as they went from town to village buying cattle. Since butchery was
considered an honourable trade, and butchers were responsible for
people’s health, it was determined that the butcher could also be
responsible for the delivery of oral messages and letters. But over time,
the Butchers’ Guild realised that keeping up with an ever-increasing
volume of messages left little time for their actual trade, and thus the
Messengers’ Guild was formed.
The Messengers’ Guild has become one of the most powerful and
influential guilds in the Empire. Other than coordinating the physical
delivery of letters and messages, the guild is responsible for the discreet
monitoring of dispatches for signs of heresy and plots against the realm.
Suspect letters are opened, examined and, if necessary, sent on to guild
cryptographers for deciphering. This access to secret knowledge, coupled
with the widely accepted convention of “courier immunity”, makes the
messenger a very effective intelligence-gathering tool.
The other main business of the Messengers’ Guild is its work with law
enforcement and the roadwardens. The Messengers’ Guild is responsible
for the delivery and posting of wanted notices, serving warrants,
protecting and escorting witnesses, and delivering condemned prisoners
to their fate.
The Imperial Messenger
The Imperial Messenger serves as the personal courier to the Emperor
and his immediate family. Candidates for the Imperial Messenger
corps are handpicked by the guild master of the Messengers’ Guild
from the best of his men. Imperial Messengers are formally appointed
and swear an oath of loyalty to the Emperor until death. An Imperial
Messenger is appointed for life; only retirement or death releases him
of his responsibilities. Attacks against an Imperial Messenger is almost
unheard of, and happens only in times of great peril such as major
Chaos or orc incursions into the Empire. Normally, the Imperial signet
emblazoned on the messenger’s pouch is more than enough to guarantee
safe passage.
Between courier runs, the Imperial Messenger remains at court and eats
in the hall. The keep Each Imperial Messenger has an assigned groom to
manage and care for his horse, who keeps the steed saddled and ready at
all times of the day and night in case an urgent message needs delivery.
Imperial Messengers are among the highest paid professionals in their
trade, and receive many extra perks such as lavish gifts upon the receipt
of good news. The lifetime appointment also means that they are among
the few professionals with true job security. Retirement and pensions are
provided, and an Imperial Messenger’s expenses are guaranteed by the
Emperor should he fall sick on a journey.

Irrefutable Evidence: Over the course of his deliveries, a messenger
has come into possession of irrefutable evidence that a local noble is in
league with the ruinous powers. Unfortunately the noble in question is
a friend of one of the character’s patrons and a local hero.
Escorting the Informant: A messenger is informed that an important
witness needs an escort to testify. The witness is speaking out against a
very powerful and corrupt tradesman (who has secretly offered a large
reward for the witness’s head).

Militiaman
I hear the Duke is calling up the militia to deal with the orcs. If they think I’m going down those holes after those
greenskins, they’ve gone completely starkers.
(Core) Militias are part-time local defence forces, formed largely from the rural peasantry. Members agree
to spend a certain amount of time each year – usually seven days – practicing together on common land.
Even this small amount of training can be the difference between life and death on the blood-soaked
battlefields of the Old World. Militia Captains are either civil leaders or retired military types. Some
militias must provide their own equipment, while the local nobility equips others. This means that while
some militia units appear for duty in smart uniforms with well-maintained equipment, others have
little more than their patchwork clothes and hunting bows.

The Town Militia of Schweinfeld
Schweinfeld is a small town typical of those found throughout
the Empire. This extends to its militia. The militia is technically
commanded by Jeroen von Lustgarten, a completely disinterested noble
forced into the position by his father who hopes the job will gives his
layabout son some drive. So far, it has failed. The actual commander is
the town’s sole dwarf, Sergeant Asgar Motz.
While Jeroen is off spending the militia treasury on whores and brandy,
Sergeant Motz has tried to make the local militia into a fighting force
that can actually defend the town and keep the peace. Motz is sincere
, earnest and diligent in his duties as only a dwarf can be, but fears
without better equipment his efforts are for naught.
The sergeant has good reason to be worried. Schweinfeld has been
targeted by a particularly vicious gang of bandits led by a disgraced
noble, Maximilian Schroeder. The so-called ‘Baron’ Schroeder (he no
longer holds any actual title) was scheduled to be hanged for murder,
sadism, and, if rumours are to be believed, blood-drinking. Some of his
more fanatical followers broke him out of prison, and he now roams the
countryside with a pack of retainers, murderers, and branded scum.
He steers clear of larger townships, cities, and byways, knowing his
ragged band are no match for the Imperial army. But Schweinfeld is a
perfect target. Already a couple of his men have infiltrated the militia,
ascertaining its numbers and strength. It is only a matter of time before
Schweinfeld is in flames, unless some particularly clever militiaman can
root out the spies, discover the threat, and blackmail Jeroen into actually
buying some weapons and armour.
Training in the Militia
For one week a year, the militia musters on the town commons to
train in the arts of war. For those seven days, they drill, march, spar,
and shoot arrows at targets. It is all very impressive and helps keep the
militia in peak readiness. This is at least the theory.
In many small towns though the reality is entirely different. The
militiamen are often scattered on farms and so when they take the
time and expense to come to town, they naturally bring their families
with them. That means the towns are flooded with visitors during the
training week. Alert merchants realised this and so started setting up
shop. Thus began the strange Imperial tradition of the Soldatenfests,
week long festivals that occur during the militia training. These small
festivals are often tremendous distractions from any actual military
practice. Capable militia captains are wise and stern enough to keep
discipline, but the weaker and less charismatic often discover that after
the first night, their troops are drunk all week long.
Adventure Seeds
 A Rotten Apple: A militiaman has stolen the pay chest for the entire
town militia. How he got access to it in the first place is something of
a mystery. Perhaps he had accomplices. But now, he must be tracked
down before the money is gone for good.
Ill-equipped for Trouble: A fire at the militia armoury ignited a
powder keg and in one flash of flame and smoke, the entire building
was reduced to rubble. Thus disarmed, the local militia is helpless.
Furthermore, word reaches the militia captain that a marauding band of
orcs has been sighted in the forest. He needs someone to quickly deliver
a shipment of weapons from the nearest city before disaster strikes.

Miner
If you hear a tapping sound, and it isn’t coming from you, best leave the mine and come back another day.
(Core) Mountains surround the Empire. To the east are the World’s Edge Mountains,
to the south the Black Mountains, and to the west the Grey Mountains. Dwarfs and
Humans have mined these mountains from time immemorial, despite constant attacks
from Goblins and other subterranean horrors. Miners brave these conditions in search
of iron, silver, gold, gems, and other valuables. Others prefer to prospect on the surface,
particularly in the Middle Mountains, which straddle the provinces of Ostland and
Hochland. Although these forest-shrouded mountains are fully within the Empire’s
borders, they are a haven for Trolls, Beastmen, and other foul creatures. Surviving in such
an environment takes skill and toughness.

The Richest Rewards
The rarest and most precious gifts the earth has to offer must be pried
from deep within her rocky bosom. Miners live a dangerous existence
plucking gems and valuable metals from the deep places of the world.
It is gruelling, backbreaking work with numerous dangers, but the
tantalising rewards often prove too tempting to keep a miner away from
his pick and shovel for long.
Cave-ins and toxic gases are often the least of a miner’s worries; goblins,
trolls, Chaos mutants and other terrifying creatures reside in tunnels
under the mountains, and the miner who hopes to enjoy a long career
must be prepared to heft his pick as a weapon as well as use it to hew
rock. Rumours also persist of a strange race of rat men who live in the
deepest cavern systems, but such gossip is dismissed by the more serious
professional miners.
Dwarfs are naturally adept at mining, and tend to be the most common
race found at this trade, though plenty of humans seek to make their
fortune by striking a lode of precious metal. A Dwarf’s short stature is
well-suited to the cramped quarters miners work in.
Although there are many wealthy mines within the Empire, the richest
seams run deep below the mountains bordering the Emperor’s lands.
This is dwarf territory, and the centuries-long concord between man
and dwarf threatens to break down when greedy human prospectors
encroach on Dwarf claims.
Little Known Facts
Dwarfs were the first to discover that some animals – namely songbirds
and small rodents – are very sensitive to the presence of poisonous gases,
dying of exposure long before the concentration is dangerous to Dwarf
or man. While a sad end for these little creatures, they are a foolproof
indicator of unseen threats, saving many lives in the process.
Miners tend to be of solitary temperament, but band together for
protection. They often deal with merchants who trade in the raw
materials they pull from the rocks, and after they’ve been paid, they
spend much of their money at inns and bawdyhouses, seeking to forget
the terrible dangers they must face daily to make their living.
Adventure Seeds
A Dwarf in Need: The characters are recruited by a desperate Dwarf
to help rescue a group of miners trapped in a nearby tunnel. Normally,
Dwarfs would seek out other Dwarfs for such a task, but time is too
short to wait for help from the distant holds. The Dwarf has reason to
believe that the cave-in was no accident, and that there are more than
just rocks blocking potential rescuers.
There’s Gold in Them Thar Hills: Gold has been discovered in the
Barren Hills, deep within the southern reaches of the Great Forest.
Despite the danger of travelling to this remote area, hordes of goldhungry
miners descend on the hills – rumour has it that fist-sized
lumps of gold can be picked off the ground. The characters are hired
by a prospector to accompany him to the hills, not only to protect him
from the denizens of the forest but also to guard his stake against rival
gold-diggers.

Minstrel
A song can touch the heart easier than a speech, and that song may teach as many about beauty as it
educates others in its words.
(Core) Minstrels are wandering musicians who travel the roads of the Old World bringing their songs and
entertainment to those who desperately need it. The original and most renowned Minstrels were Elves but
now many Humans follow in their footsteps. Minstrels are close to sacred in the Old World. They can walk
into some of the most dangerous dens of cutthroats and come out unscathed (as long as they’re willing to
provide free entertainment, of course). Occasionally, a Minstrel will accept patronage from a Noble or
Merchant and settle down for a time, composing songs at his patron’s request. Eventually, though, the
open road calls and the Minstrel moves on again.

Minstrel Schools
Many minstrels have a reputation as free spirits, but there is a certain
subculture that views music as the highest possible art form, and strive
to master their musical skills. While most folk assume minstrels only
play lutes or mandolins, they are only limited to what instruments
and music they can find and play. Once more common across the Old
World but somewhat rare today, colleges exist where minstrels can learn
to sing and perform music. The greatest benefit these schools provide is
a library of older, nigh-forgotten music, which allows minstrels to revive
interests in old ballads and revels or histories set to song.
At present, the largest school for music in the Empire lies in Nuln,
its primary focus on training singers and cantors of any faiths. A few
minstrels have established a sister school in Altdorf as well with a greater
focus on instruments of all types. There are still-smaller schools based
around one person’s music or one instrument, though many regard
them as little more than focused tutorials rather than a broader musical
education.
Halion “Dawnsong”
Halion’s surname, if not forgotten, has gone unused in the Old World
for decades. Her fame as a vocal artist and musician titled her “the
Dawn’s Voice” and most call her Dawnsong. Her silver hair and eyes
disturb some, but Dawnsong’s disarming smile warms most hearts.
This beautiful elf maid has wandered the length and breadth of the
Old World, seeking out every song she can learn. Even as a novice
entertainer, Halion sought to use music to teach her audiences more
about themselves and their neighbours. She wanted to quell the frictions
and fight Chaos by uniting people with her music.
While famed for her singing, Halion’s skills also span a number of
musical instruments. She travels with a lute and a psalterion, though her
most commonly played instrument is a tympanum of her own custom
design. Halion also plays the flute and pan-pipes, though she gets few
requests to do so, as she cannot sing while playing those instruments.
Halion’s specialty is performing “storytelling songs,” where she puts
recent or famous events to song, and thus sharing and spreading news
among the people. There are those who wish to obscure certain events
from public memory for their own selfish purposes, and Halion has
made a few political enemies of note in Marienburg and Nuln by
reminding commoners of some uncomfortable truths about leaders
both old and new.

Monk
Silence, please. I’m trying to meditate over here.
(ToS) Monks are members of the mendicant orders who seek seclusion to better devote themselves to
their faith. Some monks live completely alone as hermits, whereas others congregate with other monks
and live in monasteries, which are usually located in remote areas of the Old World. Most religions
have their own mendicant orders, although the strictures of Verena and Shallya tend to lend themselves
more towards monasticism more than most. Monks spend their lives in study and prayer, debating the
finer points of theology and illuminating religious scriptures.

A Day In The Life
The monk rises early for morning prayers, then begins his toil. The
senior or most intelligent will work in the library and scriptorium
preserving and categorizing texts, but most monks will be sent to the
abbey’s fields. The fields provide the abby with food (often simple beans
and barley) and sometimes grapes for wine, which has both religious
significance and can be sold to fund the monastery.
At regular times during the day, the bells will call the monks to prayer,
and work stops, briefly, for these rituals. Mealtimes are dull affairs where
meat or spices are rarely seen, and the food is usually the same day after
day – thin soup, porridge, boiled peas, with no salt or seasonings.
Evenings are spent in prayer, study, and sometimes debate, though it is
often the case that the young sit and the old pontificate. Then comes
sleep, six hours at most, before another day, effectively identical, begins.
It is not long before monks lose track of the months or years they have
spent in service.
Little Known Facts
The perception of the Old World is that life in a monastery varies
from “very dull” to “extremely dull,” and while this is often true, there
are exceptions. A fair number of monasteries have become hotbeds of
corrupt decadence, with an outer veneer of dull serenity covering the
drunken revelry that constantly strives for new levels of sybaritic excess.
The role of monks in preserving knowledge and lore can often be
perverted by Chaos. A few minor “errors” in translation, introduced
slowly over time, can create entire new branches of heretical thought.
An abbot who is secretly sworn to Chaos can slowly corrupt an entire
monastery, directing and shaping religious debate until the monks have
been completely subverted.
The younger sons of nobles are often sent to monasteries if there are no
lands for them to inherit and they have no gift or stomach for war. Such
individuals will sometimes try to convert the monastery into a source
for worldly pleasures, but, if they cannot, will eagerly accept any chance
to leave.
Adventure Seeds
Ancient Texts: A monk working in the abbey scriptorium has found
something shocking – an ancient copy of a well-known religious text
that differs, in many key areas, from the dozens of better known, more
recent, copies. Could the newer versions be heretical forgeries, or did
he accidently stumble on an old heresy that was never disseminated
properly? He needs to find a scholar he can trust, and seeks protection
on a long trip to a larger abbey. En route, the party is dogged by
constant attacks – mere coincidence, or did the monk stumble on
something he shouldn’t have?
Outstaying their Welcome: An abbey near the town has suffered
a terrible disaster. It has burned, but most of the monks managed to
survive and even save a good portion of the valued literature. There is
no nearby abbey, and harsh winter weather will make travel impossible,
forcing the monks to temporarily move into the town. A few dozen
ascetic scholars now find themselves living among burghers, labourers,
and rogues of all kinds. The locals are hesitant to directly attack or insult
the monks, for they fear reprisals from the church and witch hunters
if they demonstrate a lack of respect. However, the monks’ pious
preaching (not to mention those who prey on the monk’s naiveté) is
causing the normal business of the town to dissolve into confusion.

Muleskinner
We ought to be able to reach the next inn by nightfall, if we press a bit harder. It’s either that, or
risk a night in the open with raiders and wolves.
(RC) Muleskinners guide trains of pack animals, normally mules, across the
Border Princes, carrying vital supplies from one settlement to another. Vital but
cheap supplies might be transported by a single Muleskinner, while more valuable
goods merit at least a few men, and possibly mercenary guards as well. Sometimes,
the Muleskinners just don’t let on that they are carrying anything valuable
and just hope the bandits ignore them. With all their travel, Muleskinners
often know the Borderlands better than just about anyone else, and some
choose to put that knowledge to use earning a living in other ways.
Muleskinners also hold mule skinning contests. The dead mule record is
under a minute; the live mule record, held unchallenged by Alberic “Flat
Face” Schilp, is five and a half minutes.

A Day in the Life
Up at dawn with the birds, the life of the Muleskinner is a hard one.
His first order of the day, even before breaking his fast, is to look to the
mule train. Feeding the all-important beasts of burden and checking
them for injuries insures the muleskinner can fulfil his obligations.
Once he has taken care of these duties, he can look forward to a
hard day leading, or riding, his stubborn charges through oftendangerous
territory. On smaller runs, and with unimportant cargo, the
muleskinner is all that stands in the way of the bandits, goblins, and
other ne’er-do-wells that plague his travels.
His exertions make him hardy and he can well withstand the rigours
of a tough journey. Before night falls, he must find a sheltered spot to
picket the mules and set up his camp away from prying eyes. Only once
he has tended his mules once more will he dare catch a brief rest before
the work starts all over again. Only on relatively safer runs can he and
his fellows relax.
Notable Figures – Alberic “Flat-Face” Schilp
A legend in his own lifetime, Alberic holds not one, but two records
amongst the muleskinners of the Borderlands. His most famous exploit
is, of course, his live mule skinning record, earned one dark, ale-filled
evening. Not one to rest on his laurels, Alberic then did the Vapour
Gorge run in twenty-four hours.
By the time he arrived in Privy Gulch, his hair was yellow (and folks
would swear it was auburn when he started), his flat face florid, and
nine of his ten mules had died. What he was unable to load onto the
lone survivor, he had carried himself through to the end.
Adventure Seeds
The Festival: Skulduggery is afoot at the annual mule skinning festival.
Can a muleskinner keep his knife hand steady in the face of corrupt
judges, rivals spiking his beer, a mule he’s sure just spoke to him, and
the woman who is intent on marrying him?
Conditional Terms: It’s only a short job. Just run a few jars over the
pass. Trouble is, it’s been snowing for days, wolves are about, and the
smell coming from the cargo isn’t very wholesome. There are 10 gold
coins in it if the muleskinner manages to get the jars to the collection
point with the seals intact. However, the jar-owner didn’t look
particularly happy when the muleskinner asked about delivering them
with the seals broken.
A Killer Hangover: A particular merchant always hires the same team
of muleskinners to cart his wares across the Border Princes. He pays an
average rate, but if the job is finished promptly he also provides a keg
of good drink as a token of gratitude. A rival muleskinner is looking
to secure the merchant’s business, and is looking for an inside man to
spike the keg awarded by the merchant on the next job to make the
muleskinners ill and unable to work for several days. Perhaps it’s that
simple, or perhaps the rival seeks to poison the keg and remove the
competition once and for all.

Mystic
And then, from the maw of the seventh serpent sprang a fattened calf, and it spake unto me…
(RC) Some Anchorites and Cenobites become so full of wisdom (or full of something, anyway) that they
progress to being Mystics. No longer content to seek wisdom by themselves, they insist on telling others of
their discoveries, seeking to lead them to enlightenment also. Many leaders of monasteries are Mystics, as
most sensible communities drive them out as soon as they realise what they are like.
A few Mystics actually discover the secrets of supernatural power. They tout this as proof of the
value of their “insights.”

Dangerous Charismatics
While cenobites and anchorites flee the trappings of civilisation to
pursue their esoteric philosophies, many who attain the revered status
of mystic feel compelled to return to the towns and cities to illuminate
their inhabitants with their revelations.
These ragged preachers can be found ranting on street corners in urban
areas throughout civilised lands. Unless irritated citizens lynch them
first, their crazed oratory often attracts the attention of the priesthood
who have them thrown into gaol. Clerics regard them as a threat not
necessarily because of their beliefs, which are usually harmlessly bizarre
rather than heretical, but because their crazed charisma actually does
inspire the disaffected, and undermines the influence of the temples.
Unchecked, a mystic might gather a substantial following, convinced
that they can experience divine illumination without relying on priests
as intermediaries. Worse, these groups often throw off the mantle of all
authority, living in communes in the countryside, scorning traditional
values. In the eyes of the authorities, such anarchy offers a breeding
ground for Chaos worship and must be stamped out.
The Seer
Dagobert the Seer achieved spiritual illumination over twenty years ago,
when the merchant caravan he was guarding was attacked by greenskins
while traversing the Border Princes. He recovered from a blow to the
head by an orcish club with the revelation that suffering was caused by
violence, and violence was the child of avarice. He cast away his armour,
sword and other possessions, and wandered naked from settlement to
settlement preaching poverty and pacifism.
He was ridiculed at many towns, and ignored at most – just another
lunatic from the wilderness. However, as his beard grew longer and
greyer, he attracted a following of acolytes who shared his strange
philosophy, and together they founded a settlement deep in orcish
territory, convinced that the greenskins would have no interest in their
impoverished commune. The orcs came to investigate. Dagobert and his
followers greeted them with floral wreaths and gifts of beads. The orcs
left, their bellies full. Dagobert only survived because he played dead
during the slaughter, and there was so little meat on his bones that the
orcs left him untouched.
Undeterred, the mystic was soon wandering the settled lands once more,
his fervent ramblings attracting more of the desperate and dispossessed.
He has now founded a second community, dwelling a hundred feet
above the Redbite River, among the caves of Eyrie Gorge, where he and
his followers can practise their passive lifestyle undisturbed by hungry
greenskins.
Adventure Seeds
The Commune: A noble’s daughter has run away to join a commune
headed by a charismatic mystic. The priesthood has been lax at
suppressing the mystic’s rantings, and the nobleman is desperate for his
daughter to be rescued before the witch-hunters sniff out the heretic
community. He hires the adventurers to extract his daughter from the
mystic’s clutches.
The End is Nigh!: The adventurers are dogged by a ragged lunatic who
claims that he dreamt of the world ending in a tornado of blood. He
insists that in his dreams, the adventurers saved the world, but only by
doing what he demanded. Is the party prepared to follow the madman’s
ridiculous instructions? What catastrophe awaits should they ignore his
pronouncements of doom?

Navigator
Based on my calculations, we need to adjust our heading starboard by ten degrees. Suit yourself, but
don’t complain to me when we miss the next port.
(Core) Navigators have the critically important task of getting a ship where it is supposed to go.
Old World Navigators typically use charts to set their course, though they are often also capable
of navigating by sun and stars. Navigators know the secrets of wind and tide, which makes them
seem somewhat mystical to their sailor brethren and they are often regarded as a breed apart.
Navigators are, by necessity, cartographers, charting the course of their voyages so that they may
retrace them or that others may follow their route. As there are no compasses in the world, all
ships employ a skilled Navigator, as do some overland expeditions.

Affiliations
Navigation is a solitary occupation—while undergoing a voyage, most
sailors leave navigators alone, afraid to distract them and thus risk the
ship’s safety. Perhaps because of this, when ashore, navigators seek out
their fellows as much as possible, revelling in camaraderie whenever
available. This inclination also makes navigators eager to join any
suitable organisation, as such groups give them a good opportunity to
gather and meet like-minded individuals.
Imperial Geographic Society: This is the Empire’s official organisation
for cartographers. Not every member is a navigator, of course – many
cartographers never leave land, and indeed some never leave their cosy
offices, preferring to work from the descriptions of others. But other
members are more adventurous, and are eager to examine landmarks
themselves, both by sea and by land. Most major Empire cities have an
office of the society where members can gather, relate adventures and
update maps.
Navigators’ Club: This more casual group is the closest navigators
have to their own private club. In order to join, you must be a seasoned
navigator with at least three sea voyages to your credit – trips where you
shared navigation duties do not count. Navigators gather at dockside
taverns in every city, and whenever three or more are together, they
declare it an official Navigators’ Club meeting. All this really means is
that, when recounting tales of that night to other navigators, they will
preface the story with “You missed a splendid meeting!”
Guild of Explorers: The Guild of Explorers is open to anyone who
travels the Empire and beyond in search of new places and new
knowledge. Navigators are always looking for new routes and new lands,
so they fit right in. The guild is loosely structured, and the only regular
meetings occur at the University in Altdorf, but whenever two members
meet, they sit down, drink and exchange tales.
Notable Figures
Rangur Star-eye did not set out to be a navigator. After running away
from home he became a cabin boy, then a sailor. But during a terrible
storm, the ship’s navigator was washed overboard, and when the storm
had passed, the surviving sailors realised they were lost.
“No we ain’t,” Rangur corrected. He pointed at the night sky. “There’s
the Old Wolf right there, so’s the Empire lies that way.”
With no other options, the captain decreed that they follow the boy’s
directions, and soon enough they were gliding into port at Altdorf.
When they shipped out again, they had a new navigator and Rangur
was his apprentice. Rangur became famous for his sharp eye and his
knowledge of the stars, and guided many a ship home safely before
eventually retiring from the sea. He now teaches navigation at the
University in Altdorf, and it is said he never turns away a student, no
matter how poor.
Adventure Seeds
A Mysterious Map: A strange map finds its way to a sea captain.
It shows a route to Ind, one that, if accurate, would cut the long sea
voyage in half. Such a route could make a captain rich, if it were true.
Of course he decides to investigate, and advertises a commission for a
navigator to join him and see his ship safely along the charted course.

(SoA) It used to be that scribes had a monopoly on the written word but that changed
with the invention of the printing press. Now newssheets have become common in the
towns and cities of the Empire. They are usually published once a day and are filled
with local news and sensational tales. A big story may merit a special edition.
Newssheet vendors walk the streets, calling out the top headlines and trying to
outdo each other with their theatrics. There are many newssheet publishers in each
city and the competition amongst them is savage. It is not unknown for rival vendors
to fight each other in the streets. Ironically, big brawls of this type often become tomorrow’s

The Daily Relation
Short for “The Daily Relation of News Commendable, Historic and
Beneficial,” this is arguably the Old World’s oldest published newssheet.
Originating in Nuln, this ragged populist scream sheet now circulates
throughout the Empire. The news-sheet is unquestionably biased.
Almost every article supports one of three premises: the upper class
(nobles and merchants in particular) is corrupt, the major religions of
the Empire are almost as bad as the upper class (though religion itself is
commendable), and the lower class (peasants and farmers in particular)
are worthy fellows. This message does not sit well with many nobles,
and so the Daily Relation is constantly being persecuted.
The chief editor, Johann Darolus, is undaunted. Johann is a man on a
mission – to free the Empire from the grip of decadent and worthless
nobility and to see it become a republic. Of course, he keeps his
treasonous thoughts largely to himself, but it does colour all of his work.
Johann is constantly on the lookout for like-minded individuals to join
his cause and to help him promote and sell his newspaper. There are
rumours that at night, there are secret meetings held in his printing
office. Could it be that Johann is no longer content to simply report the
news? Perhaps he is about to make some news of his own?
The Veracitor
Short for “Being the most Noble Veracitor – Gazetteer of the Truth
and Guardian of Principle Imperial Values,” this is the Daily Relation’s
bitterest rival. Originating in Altdorf, this is published weekly and
is of considerably higher quality and cost than the Daily Relation
(costing a full crown, compared to the Relation’s two shillings). It also
has a considerably different focus. This is the newssheet for the elite.
Focusing on the affairs of court and generous projects undertaken by
the Empire’s magnanimous noble masters, this newssheet rarely misses
an opportunity to fawn over the upper classes. But if one is looking for
the state of the Imperial Court in Altdorf, one could scarcely get a better
primer than reading a month or two of the Veracitor.
The Veracitor is led by press-master Sir Ludovic von Klassen (he
disdains the term ‘editor’ as being too plebeian). This knight and retired
captain in the Imperial army is a staunch traditionalist. He deeply
believes that rags such as the Daily Relation stir up the populace against
their true lords and undermine the venerable institutions of his beloved
fatherland. He resolved not to stand by and watch this happen, but to
fight it at the press and in the streets.
Adventure Seeds
News or Slander? A series of murders against nobles and priests has
been carried out in Nuln. Could it be that Johann Darolus has finally
begun his campaign to undermine the Imperial government? Or could
it be that a vindictive former newssheet vendor is trying to frame him?
The Might of Pens and Swords: A news-sheet vendor is found gutted
in back alley. The word on the street has it that the local franchises of
the Weekly Veracitor and the Daily Relation stand on the edge of what
amounts to a gang war. Can someone stop this violence and find the
real killer? Could it be that his murder has more to do with the vendor’s
attempt to woo the youngest daughter of the town’s most influential
merchant house?

Noble
Being born into a noble house isn’t as easy as it appears. You’re constantly faced with dilemmas. Which silk tunic
should I wear today? What wine shall I have with my roasted pheasant?
(Core) The Nobles are the ruling class of the Empire. They wield the power, they control the land, and they make
the laws. The most important Noble families are those of Imperial Electors and of course the Emperor himself.
There are hundreds of others though, and they all vie for more money and more power. Some seek their fortunes
in war, others in business or politics. None would sully themselves by practicing a common trade. The most
contemptible Nobles do nothing at all, merely live off their family wealth and attend an endless array of
parties, dances, and gala events. The younger children of Noble houses, however, do not have it so easy. Since
inheritance goes to the eldest, they must often make their own way in the world, even if it means slumming
amongst the lower classes and falling in with adventurers and ne’er-do-wells.

A Day in the Life
Upon waking in a sumptuous bedroom the noble calls for servants to
help him groom, dress and bring him breakfast. He may wish to hear
some music, and a lute player will be summoned. He may wish to visit
the town, in which case servants prepare his carriage and drape a green
velvet cloak about his shoulders.
Most of the people the noble meets seek his favour through sycophantic
shows of obedience, but he may have to deal with less deferential
individuals. A farmer may complain about taxes, or a bereaved woman
whines that if the Cult of Shallya had better funding her infant need
not have suffered. Occasionally there might be a moment of drama as
an angry young man flings something unpleasent at the noble before
dashing off. If the local watch are alert enough the noble may have the
satisfaction of seeing the churl hung.
All are distractions from the business of the day – statecraft and
socialising. He will meet with magisters, guild masters, priests and
burgomeisters, and review the performance of his underlings, bailiffs,
heralds and watch sergeants. He may draft a new law or decide to
instigate some military adventure. The evening might be spent amongst
his noble peers at a high class club, enjoying the latest Sierck production
at a theatre, or dancing an elegant waltz at a ball.
Social Responsibility and the Nobility
Whilst agitators might decry them as corrupt parasites, many nobles
realise they are expected (though not required) to act as paragons of
virtue. Nobles with a social conscience, or a deeper understanding of
politics, know that every time they behave in a less than exemplary
manner they provide ammunition to those who seek to attack the
nobility. Such nobles try their best to set an example to thosebelow
them. They court public opinion by donating to Shallyan orphanages,
or by taking a prominent position in the ranks of the military during
times of conflict.
More selfish or ignorant members of the nobility don’t bother
themselves with such a burden of responsibility. This obnoxious
behaviour is most notable in the archetypal ‘rake.’ These are usually
young and foppish nobles who takes pleasure in inflicting all manner of
childish and humiliating pranks on their social inferiors, knowing they
will be able to buy or intimidate himself out of any trouble they might
get into as a result. Gangs of such rakes can be encountered ‘slumming
it’ in many cities of the Old World, drunk on expensive liquor and
looking for entertainment.
Adventure Seeds
Insolence or Incompetence: A young rake has finally gone too far
with his obnoxious pranks and has been posted to Blackfire Pass as
punishment. His leadership is not particularly inspiring to the soldiers
garrisoned there, and when they hear that a horde of Orcs is mustering
in the mountains they begin to become mutinous. The PCs could be
numbered among the soldiers who find themselves with a spoilt and
incompetent commander, or they could be the noble and his retinue
who find themselves in charge of an insubordinate army.
Redirection of Funds: The nobility of Wurtbad have recently taken
the rather shocking step of stopping funds to the local cult of Shallya.
Are their assurances that such steps are necessary to re-equip the militia
to be taken seriously, or are the rumours of surreptitious meetings with
the masters of the physicians’ guild more likely?

(Core) Noble Lords are members of the nobility with actual power and responsibility, unlike the
many dilettantes who fill the courts of the Old World. Some inherit their positions, whereas others
forcefully claw their way to them. All of them tend to be strong-willed, adroit public speakers, and
skilled fighters. They must be adept at resolving local disputes, negotiating court politics, and leading
troops in the field. Some of the most powerful Noble Lords in the Empire are the Elector Counts
who choose from among their number who will be the next Emperor.

Little Known Fact – The Nobility and the Law
Common knowledge has it that to be noble is to be above the law. The
truth of this depends on where and who the noble is. An important
Norse jarl might be able to behave in a violently sociopathic manner
with no thought for the consequences, but a Reikland lord could not
carve a rampage through the streets of Altdorf with impunity. Also, to
be a known noble in one of the Tilean republics can be something of an
imposition.
Watchmen in the Empire are careful about arresting anyone of noble
birth. They might take note of nobles committing crimes, but do
nothing more than report it to influential authorities such as the Cult of
Verena or another noble. The drunk and disorderly behaviour of a rake
is unlikely to be censured, even when indulging in dangerous pranks.
Once informed of a noble’s bad behaviour, his peers will tend to make
an example of him, as the aristocracy realise that demonstrations of
even-handedness are well received among the great unwashed masses.
However this example usually extends to withdrawal of privileges,
stopping far short of the public executions used to deal with common
criminals.
The watch will intervene if they find a noble committing a clearly
shocking or treasonous crime, but they will take care to treat the noble
with utmost respect throughout the process. It is common to find
nobles serving lengthy prison sentences in surroundings that most men
would consider palatial, and enjoying perks their own gaolers would
find luxurious. In the meantime those who informed on or captured the
noble may find that they a hard time remaining employed, and could
even become the targets of harassment organised by the noble’s cronies.
Affiliations
The affiliations of any noble lord of worth encompasses all levels of
society. They command the military, hobnob with the priesthood,
listen to the concerns of guild masters, employ (or outright own) the
peasantry, and sponsor artists and businesses. In times of unrest they
broker deals to keep the peace with crime lords and watch captains
alike. They meet with the ambassadors of foreign nations, and even
the other races of the Old World. Members of any given profession
may find themselves patronised by a noble lord, from rat catchers to
coachmen, bailiffs to assassins.
Adventure Seeds
To Be Young Again: Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz of Nuln
can deny it no longer, she is now over 40 (though only the suicidal
would press the point). A dashing adventurer has recently been a
guest of her court, enthralling listeners with tales of distant Lustria.
While there, he heard tell of a cruel race of Elves who inhabit a frozen
land to the north of the New World. It is said that certain Elven
noblewomen there practise a rite to rejuvenate themselves, bathing in
blood and emerging lithe and youthful, no matter what their real age.
The Countess is intrigued and seeks to know more. The blood-bathing
business sounds perfectly ghastly, but not quite as vile as the thought of
more grey hairs and crow’s feet.
The Feud: A noble lord is becoming increasing bellicose towards one
of his neighbours. Old feuds or irreconcilable ethical differences might
be cited, but resources such as control of a newly established silver mine
probably form the real cause for war. Other noble lords might seek to
pour oil on troubled waters, or they may encourage their peers in the
hope of an exciting bloody spectacle.

Norse Berserker
No make Skorri angry. Not like when angry. Pay wages now.
(Core) Norsca is a grim northern land, full of fell beasts such as Ice Trolls and
Chaos Spawn, and it breeds tough fighters. The berserkers are a rightly feared warrior
cult. Its members go into battle without armour to prove they have no fear. They work
themselves into an incredible rage, often biting on their own shields. Their feats fill the
sagas and loom large in the stories of those Imperial soldiers that have faced them. Some
few berserkers make their way to the Empire because they’ve been exiled or simply have a
desire to see more of the world. They rarely stay in one place for long, since no Watchman
wants a frothing lunatic disturbing the peace. Berserkers are highly prized Mercenaries,
however, due to their rarity and effectiveness.

Affiliations
There are no formal organisations of Norse berserkers in Norsca, but
things are different in the Empire. Half-mad warriors are not trusted,
particularly those from near the Chaos Wastes, so a Norse berserker
without a group to back him up is an easy target for witch hunters and
the paranoid.
Most Norse berserkers join a mercenary company, where they are
welcome as long as they do not cause serious injuries to their comrades
in the inevitable brawls. In general, mercenary berserkers gain the
respect of their comrades after the first battle.
Others enter the service of wealthy individuals who want a truly
intimidating bodyguard. Berserkers in these jobs find less camaraderie,
and are often out of work after entering a frenzy and grossly
overreacting to a slight against their employer.
A few just find like-minded individuals and form a small group looking
for adventure. Such groups are treated with even more suspicion than
a lone berserker, but they are often dangerous enough to dissuade most
watchmen from starting trouble.
Little Known Facts
Many Norse berserkers were not, in fact, berserkers in their homelands.
When they came south, they found that people in the Empire expected
all warriors from the north to be subject to frenzied rages, and had to
play up to that image to find work. After pretending for a little while,
they soon found it wasn’t an act for them any more. Most of these
berserkers are now convinced that the rage truly is in the blood of their
people, needing only the right environment to draw it out.
Some Norscan tribes serve the Ruinous Powers, and send out berserkers
as agents to undermine the soft lands to the south, making them ripe
for raiding. Among themselves, the berserkers tell stories of Norscans
sent south with magically-programmed commands of which they are
completely unaware. These berserkers are said to spring into suicidal
and destructive action when they encounter a particular situation or
hear a certain phrase. Many berserkers worry about whether they are
such agents, but all try to make sure that no Imperial citizens hear these
stories.
Adventure Seeds
A Brotherly Request: The Norse berserker’s brother turns up, having
tracked him across the Empire. He brings news of a terrible threat to
their village, combined with rumours of an enormous treasure, and says
that he was sent to bring the berserker back. The brother is much as the
berserker remembers, but after a time he realises that his brother always
keeps his right leg covered, and is rather evasive when asked why the
village would send someone so far to bring back a single warrior.
Proof of Innocence: The Norse berserker is seized by the watch and
thrown into a cage to await sentencing for a series of brutal murders.
Before he can do anything but protest his innocence, one of the
watchmen who arrested him is murdered. The charge is changed to
witchcraft, as the berserker clearly managed to escape the cage to
commit the crime. Fortunately, on examination, it looks like the
berserker could escape his cage, with nothing more than brute force.
How convenient.

While many Outlaws are nothing more than common thieves, robbing coaches and caravans, others claim
to champion the peasantry and fight for “justice not law.” As long as the Outlaws confine their attacks to
the rich, the Peasants aid them with food, information, and places to hide. This support, and the rough
terrain Outlaws use for their bases, makes them difficult for the state to deal with. Local Nobles often
resort to the use of Bounty Hunters to end their bandit troubles.

Life of an Outlaw
Outlaws exist wherever there are people to be fleeced from their hard
earned coin. From the largest city to the smallest forested road, the
outlaw’s domain is as diverse as the people they harass. They rely either
on secrecy or a remote location to avoid being caught, and some even
make an effort to keep their offences minimal to maintain a low profile;
if they attract too much attention, a reward is posted for their capture
and then they’ll have more trouble than they can handle. Consequently,
it’s in their best interests to not leave witnesses behind who might tell
the authorities of the outlaws’ exploits. Some of the larger outlaw bands
eventually migrate towards the Border Princes, where they are free to
establish their own rule of law under the guidance of a strong leader.
Otherwise, without some sort of leadership, most loose packs and bands
of wandering outlaws tend to fragment and disperse over time. They
simply lack the discipline to work together with other miscreants and
ruffians for extended lengths of time .
Heinz Gerber
Rumours circulate through the small towns and villages throughout
Wissenland about the elusive outlaw Heinz Gerber. The infamous
outlaw has grown quite a reputation for himself, and is oft credited
with terrorising merchant wagons, coaches and skiffs along virtually any
road, trail or river found south of the Upper Reik.
Heinz has been a constant source of irritation and frustration for local
constabularies and roadwardens for several years now. A merchant
arriving in Steingart curses Gerber’s name for waylaying him along his
route, while further south in Meissen, riverwardens receive reports of
Heinz Gerber stealing a trading skiff laden with spices and foodstuffs.
The man is simply in too many places at one time.
As such, a sizeable bounty has been created – currently 75 gold crowns
are being offered for the capture of the notorious outlaw. However, no
two warrants or wanted posters bear the same information, and none of
the sketches of the man are in the least ways consistent or detailed.
Heinz Gerber’s infamy has spread thanks to the criminal enterprises
of the remaining Gerber brothers Stevron, Jakob and Dieter. They are
the younger brothers of the true Heinz Gerber. However, when Heinz
ran afoul of a witch hunter near Loningbruck and was hanged for
his numerous crimes, the surviving brothers took matters into their

pact amongst themselves, the three remaining brothers split up, each
wreaking havoc under Heinz’s name, spreading his story and legend

Brotherhood of the Wolf: The characters run afoul of a high-ranking
magistrate who banishes them from civilised lands on trumped-up
charges. The characters seek sanctuary in the forest, where they are
attacked by beastman, but rescued by a group of outlaws wearing
wolf pelts. The characters must decide whether to embrace their new
life as wolf-brothers, or to try to clear their names. The outlaws are
themselves victims of the magistrate’s tyranny, and will be glad to help
the characters topple him from power.
A Plea for Help: An isolated Reikland village finds itself the centre
of a struggle between two rival outlaw bands. The villagers are hardpressed
to support the demands of both groups, and both sides have
threatened to destroy the villagers’ homes if they help their rivals.
The authority of the Emperor is weak in this remote region, and the
corrupt local lord uninterested in the affairs of mere peasants, so the
villagers send out one of their own to seek a band of adventurers
willing to rid them of the outlaws.

Outlaw Chief
This isn’t some sort of mercenary company. Once you’re in, you become part of the family. If you want to run
with us, you take the bad with the good.
(Core) Every band of brigands needs a leader. An Outlaw who shows he is both cunning and
bold can rise to the level of Outlaw Chief. Commanding a lawless group of dangerous men is
no easy task and the perilous forests of the Old World don’t make the job any easier. Outlaw
Chiefs get their pick of the loot their band acquires, but they are also held responsible for
every failure and their grasp on leadership is tenuous. Outlaw bands are notorious for not
allowing any of their members to simply retire, which may make leaving the Chief’s post a
difficult task.

Managing a Band of Outlaws
The first step to recruiting new outlaws is establishing trust, for bounty
hunters have been known to infiltrate outlaw gangs. Displaying an arrest
warrant or demonstrating one’s criminal nature should be sufficient.
The second step is to convince outlaws of one’s leadership ability, either
by proposing a clever heist or by paying a small initial wage with the
promise of more. If one of these conditions isn’t met, the prospective
chief will be forced to rely on charm or intimidation to convince the
scum to follow him.
Players can use the Bandit standard profile for NPC Outlaws (see
WFRP, page 233). Each NPC Outlaw should have a name and a
distinguishing trait to set him apart from the others. Outlaws expect a
fair share of the loot (usually negotiated up-front) and morale is entirely
dependent upon the Outlaw Chief’s success. For each failed mission,
the Outlaw Chief’s Command Tests should be penalised by -10%, and
for each successful mission they should improve by +10%. Outlaws are
inclined to flee rather than risk capture or death.
A GM may decide that an Outlaw Chief who has been deposed from
leadership is prohibited from spending experience on stat advances until
at least one new Outlaw is recruited.
Bibino “The Count” Ortichino
The third son of a Tilean prince, Bibino lost his inheritance when his
promised parcel of land was claimed by an Estalian margrave as hostage
ransom. After receiving the news, Bibino found and killed the Estalian,
then fled to Sartosa to avoid reprisals.
Bibino soon discovered that sea-sickness would limit his career as
a pirate, but his ambitious yet carefree style did attract followers,
including many outlaws and a halfling Barber Surgeon. Bibino’s crew
followed him eastward to the Border Princes, where ancient Nehekharan
gold was rumoured to be buried.
Bibino plans to amass enough gold to build a keep, and he’s promised
each of his men a plot of land within the future princedom. His men
are loyal and deferential, addressing their chief as “Count Ortichino.”
Having failed to locate any gold thus far, the outlaws have conducted
a series of raids into the Darklands, each one more disastrous than the
last. On its most recent raid, the outlaw band returned with only two
barrels of hobgoblin rotgut at the cost of eight men.
Bibino plies new recruits with booze until they become alcoholics and
often awards alcohol in lieu of cash payment. He manages to keep his
wits sharp despite the constant revelry that has become the hallmark of
his camp.

Questioning Authority: The local noble has issued a decree outlawing
mining in the nearby hills. Deprived of their livelihoods, the miners
seek an experienced outlaw chief to conduct retaliatory strikes against
the noble, distracting him while the miners continue their work. The
outlaw chief’s decisions are frequently questioned by a veteran in the
band, and several outlaws support the veteran. With the band divided
into two camps, they receive news that the Sigmarite Lector is offering
a formal pardon to outlaws who turn in their fellows. Paranoia reaches a
new level; the schism must be confronted.

Outrider
We are not the first to pass this way. See the tracks? I fear we are hunted.
(Core) Outriders are experienced outdoorsmen who reconnoitre for armies, caravans,
and other travelling parties. They are the eyes and ears, constantly on the lookout for
ambushes and other hazards. Because they operate in advance of the main party, they
must be self-sufficient and level-headed. Outriders must trust their instincts and make
their own decisions, because they have no one else to turn to when they are alone in
the wild. Most Outriders operate in home area and use their intimate knowledge
of the locale to their advantage. A few specialize in trailblazing, riding ahead into
unknown and hostile territory. These Outriders earn more money for their services,
but their life expectancy is short.

Lenore Reiss
Lady Lenore never fit in well inside a city. Even as a little girl she
preferred the company of horses to her boorish family and their
friends. Born into privilege in Altdorf, she fled as soon as she was able,
abandoning a gigantic dowry and the promise of a life of leisure. She
joined a gang of rough outriders, who were little interested in letting
a woman into their ranks. She earned their respect the only way she
could – by showing them she could handle herself. Since then, she’s
become something of a folk hero – the legendary Lady Lenore of the
Wilderland.
Lenore usually wears a shapeless grey cloak, hood, and mask. There is
a reason for this garb – Lenore is stunningly beautiful. She hates to be
judged by appearances and so the mask and hood cover her features
and long golden tresses quite well. Although she works as an outrider
and caravan guide to earn money, she views herself as a defender of the
people. Several times she has organised groups of her fellow outriders
to ride down bandits and beasts preying on defenceless farmers and
townsfolk. This has only reinforced her status as a hero of the people.
Unfortunately, it has also made enemies. The local constabulary and
nobility do not appreciate Lenore’s popularity among the peasantry.
They wonder what she plans to do with this influence she appears to be
gathering. They worry that the next ‘monster’ she may be hunting may
be them.
The Satchel Boys
Not all outriders are guides and caravan guards. Some serve as the
messengers of the Empire. These so-called ‘Satchel Boys’ are usually
young, independent, and accomplished riders. They are not technically
agents of the Imperial government. Instead they are freelance
messengers who deliver letters and mail across the Emperor’s domain.
They are never entrusted with anything truly monumental, and are
usually penniless and lightning fast – bandits usually give pass these
boys up and concentrate on wealthier, slower prey. Still, it is a dangerous
job and more than one Satchel Boy has headed down a dark forest road
never to be seen again.
Note: An Outrider with this background may (at the GM’s discretion)
substitute Specialist Weapon Group (Entangling) for the New Talent –
Lightning Fast Rider.

(SoE) The printing press is a new invention in the Empire, and as yet its presence has not changed
much of society. Its presence is however keenly felt among agitators, demagogues, and street
politicians who now have a whole new way to reach their public. Pamphleteers are more than
just tradesmen with a paper-press: They are passionate individuals who research, write, sketch
and print political or religious works in order to spread their message, then disseminate
their materials across whole cities and provinces. Although printing itself is perfectly legal
and increasingly respectable, many pamphleteers print material that is neither, and those
who wish to stay in business have to be skillful at escaping the attention of the Watch or more
powerful enemies.

Calvin Kenzig
Calvin Kenzig is a pamphleteer who works the streets of Altdorf. He has
a knack for rabble rousing and shamelessly caters to the lower end of the
market.
His Altdorf Celestial Body newsletter is famous for its sensationalist
headlines (which often don’t reflect the actuality of the story) and its
suggestive woodcut reproductions of comely Altdorf maidens. Since its
first printing, it quickly became one of the most popular newssheets in
the capital.
While many people like to look down upon those who read the rag, it
is a guilty pleasure to many. It seems that almost everyone is tempted
to take a peak at the latest lurid headline or tawdry scandal. Because of
this, Clavin Kenzig has a lot more power than people sometimes credit
him with. Even the most important citizens go out of their way to
ensure they get a good write-up in the Celestial Body. And woe betide a
public figure whom he decides to turn against.
If You’re Not Part of the Solution...
The successful pamphleteer needs to show a certain amount of care,
especially in these uncertain times. It’s no good just writing up a gripe
and printing it. That might get it off your chest but before you know
it, you’ll be up before the beak having your press confiscated. You must
have a knack for realpolitik. Learn to moderate your language, couch
your harshest criticisms in the most polite terms. Flatter those who
might be able to help you; they could donate to the cause, or keep you
out of the way of the law. There is nothing wrong with that, especially if
it leads to a better world.
The local magistrate might be part of the problem, but you’re not going
to solve anything by throwing a few insults his way. Write something
nice about him, and maybe next time someone petitions him to issue
an arrest warrant with your name on it, he might be inclined to refuse.
If you must criticise the head of the watch, make sure you say that the
average watchman is doing his best in difficult circumstances. You know
this will make it better for you, if you end up down the watch station.
Taking a gentle approach might be the best way to succeed, you
will catch more flies with sugar than you will with vinegar. In fact,
perhaps the most effective, or at least the safest, way to bring down the
establishment is not to criticise them at all, and let someone else do it.

Peasant
But my lord, the harvest was terrible; if I pay you that much in taxes I’ll have naught to eat for the winter!
(Core) The peasantry makes up the preponderance of the Empire’s population. While the
Nobles rule and the Burghers trade, the Peasants toil. They are farmers, labourers, and
herdsman. In times of war, they fight and die for the Empire. Many Peasants seek a better life
in the city, only to join the legion of beggars on the verge of starvation. The majority spends
their whole lives in the village they were born in, surrounded by hostile country and only
occasionally getting news of the outside world. While they are provincial and superstitious,
the Peasants are the heart of the Empire.

A Day In The Life
Peasants labour from dawn to dusk, seven days a week. They must pay
their taxes, plus their rent and any other expenses, out of the foodstuffs
or goods produced by their labour. It is difficult to imagine a more
dreary, more bleak existence than the sort of life scratched out by a hard
working peasant.
If the harvest is good, there is a surplus and the peasants thrive and can
forget their woes – at least for a short while. In years when the harvest is
bad, they face a long, cold winter with not enough to eat, and the threat
of starvation or freezing to death are constant companions.
It is a sad fact that the vast majority of peasants never wander far from
the place where they were born; their world ends at the boundary of the
village and fields they work. However, despite the arduous work and life
of toil, even peasants can find joy, for many celebrate the little victories
and blessings of life with a zeal and passion that only one who has
laboured so much to reap so little can appreciate.
Notable Figures
There are few examples of peasants who have moved beyond their
meagre station in life, but history has turned out a few exceptions.
There are examples of great military strategists and religious leaders who
rose from a humble background to earn renown and fame. However,
an individual must be truly driven to achieve such heights when life is
stacked against them from birth onward.
Ortho the Mighty is a classic example of one who rose to fame through
dedication and skill at arms. As a young man, he rallied his fellow
peasants to fend of a band of goblins from decimating their fields
and burning the crops. His efforts caught the attention of a travelling
merchant, who in turn relayed Ortho’s cool-headedness, tenacity and
grit to his friend, the captain of the watch in a nearby city. The captain
was so impressed he travelled to the farming community to meet with
young Ortho, and recruited him to join the watch.
And so Ortho’s rise began. He excelled within the watch, and soon took
over as captain once his former recruiter and friend retired. Now in
his mid thirties, Ortho is happy to recount his personal life story, and
show how dedication and determination in the name of the Empire
never truly goes unrewarded. And he should know – as this former
peasant, former watchman, and former mercenary is now the personal
bodyguard for the Elector of Ostland,

Pauper or Pretender? While passing through a small hamlet, a
local peasant throws himself in front of the characters and begs for
protection. It’s unclear exactly why this individual needs protection,
but he is persistent, pleading with the characters that he is not what he
seems, but someone of noble birth in hiding. Soon it becomes clear that
this bumpkin has more than a few enemies in the village, and things
start to get suspicious. That night, some of the characters’ valuables have
suddenly gone missing, and so has the peasant.
Conscription Services: The characters have been sent to scout local
villages for likely candidates to conscript into the region’s standing
militia. They have been cautioned to keep quiet about what they’re
doing; peasants don’t look kindly on outsiders sizing them up to be
taken away for the army. There may also be secrets the villagers are
trying to keep hidden from the militia.

Penitent
I have been very, very bad.
(ToS) Penitents wander the streets of the Old World, crying out that they
are heretics and unworthy while beating themselves, or each other, to purge
their wickedness. Groups of penitents practise the Torture Skill on each other,
which gives members of this career a particularly good understanding of how
it works.
As noted above, penitents are particularly common among followers
of Sigmar, but they are found among the more committed of the
followers of all Gods.

Penitent Dogma
Manann: Manann is a generally indifferent patron who has little
interaction with his followers whether they are devout or not. Ironically,
there is a growing sect of Manann penitents who believe their god’s
ambivalence is directly related to their lack of self-castigation. Penitents
of Manann tend to favour self-mortification with fish hooks, and a new
form of torment they have been pioneering called “water–logging”.
Morr: Penitents of Morr continually try to redeem themselves for any
number of transgressions against their tireless god. There are so many
intricate regulations and strictures concerning the funereal process, and
one small oversight or gaffe can entirely undo the sanctity of a ritual.
The most committed penitents of Morr are a short-lived few who
administer funeral rites in places of virulent plague.
Myrmidia: Most followers of the “sensible” warrior goddess believe
that their patron would not wish her adherents to waste time with futile
self-flagellation. Mistakes happen, and lapses in judgement often occur
in the heat of battle. Only the greatest transgressions against Myrmidia’s
strictures must be answered with penance. Cowardice that results in the
death of comrades is such a transgression, and Myrmidian penitents
guilty of this offence follow a similar path to the dwarf Slayer cult.
Ranald: Penitents of Ranald are unique in the Old World because
their redemptive efforts are forced upon them rather than voluntary.
Sticky-fingered thieves who overstep their boundaries and bring down
too much heat on the community, are often “compelled” to return the
goods (surreptitiously, of course). If the individual cultist survives his
compulsory atonement, he is considered redeemed.
Shallya: Shallyans do not believe in castigation, and prefer to deal with
breaches in discipline through meditation and civic outreach.
Sigmar: The Sigmarite cults are particularly fond of self-punishment,
and their ranks provide the most diverse range of penitents. Any of the
acts of contrition described in WFRP, page 175 are appropriate.
Taal and Rhya: Followers of Taal and Rhya look towards nature to
provide their methods of reparation. Minor transgressions can lead to
banishment in an inhospitable wilderness for a predetermined length
of time. Those guilty of major trespasses can only be redeemed through
a lengthy sacrifice ritual involving a powerful forest creature that the
penitent has captured bare-handed.
Ulric: The God of Battle and Winter prefers that his attendants
sort out their own problems through trial by combat. Most matters
are resolved by pitting the offending party against a pack of wolves;
however, the Cult of Ulric is also known to employ a special cabal of
deadly judicial champions to face the worst transgressors.
Verena: The Goddess of Learning and Justice does not suffer fools
gladly. Penitents are required to maintain a detailed list of their offences
which they must rewrite entirely every time a new entry is required.
Further penance can be made through the meticulous copying of
religious tomes. It’s a little known fact that many of the major religious
cults employ Verenan penitents to copy their liturgical texts.
Adventure Seeds
Day of Reckoning: An important holy day is fast approaching where
the cult will decide who is following the correct path to redemption and
who must be purged from their ranks – violently, if necessary.

(Core) Physicians are practitioners of the healing arts who study the mysteries of illness and anatomy. The
science of medicine is relatively new and still distrusted by the majority of Old World citizens. Many regard
unknown Physicians as either trumped up apothecaries or dangerous quacks until they’ve proven themselves.
Skilled Physicians, however, are often well-respected members of their communities. They are capable of dealing
with most minor ailments and a number of more straightforward injuries, such as major cuts or crushing
wounds. Physicians are often eager to seek out new medicines and learn about more effective treatments.

Little Known Facts
Many physicians-in-training accompany an army on campaign so as to
attend the wounded and study injuries first-hand. A battle’s aftermath
provides many corpses to dissect.
Physicians are very skilled with small blades, due to their training
in surgery. Although they usually use their blades to save lives, it is
not wise to get into an altercation with a seasoned physician, as their
knowledge of anatomy means they know exactly where to strike to cause
serious injury.
Before becoming a member of the Physicians’ Guild, physicians swear
a solemn oath pledging before Shallya that they will use their skills to
preserve life, never take it.
Physicians often look down on “uneducated” practitioners of the
healing arts. While an apothecary or village wise woman may brew
poultices that heal wounds, the physician is quick to dismiss any results
from such practises as mere coincidence.
Some might assume physicians would tend to be pacifists or at least
disinclined toward wars and confrontation, since none know better the
gruesome effect of war on the frail mortal body. However, often the
opposite is true. While the physician may be among the last to take
up arms in a conflict, a physician’s skills are always in demand come
wartime.
Some less-than-scrupulous physicians have been known to enter into
agreements with the local jailer to provide them with test subjects for
their potions and concoctions, in return for a small bribe.
Notable Figures
Before he became a physician, Matthias Gruener first worked as
a butcher’s apprentice. Matthias was fascinated by the marbling
of muscles and tendons, and began studying the way limbs were
assembled, dissecting pork loins and turkey legs to understand them
better. Finally, after his master gave him a sound beating for destroying
a good leg of lamb, Matthias realised his calling lay elsewhere. He found
an old surgeon whose hands shook from drink, but whose eyes and
mind were still sharp. By supplying the doting surgeon a regular supply
of alcohol, Matthias slowly began to learn the medical trade. Soon
Matthias had hung up one bloody apron for another, and traded his
cleaver for a scalpel. During the Storm of Chaos, he joined the baggage
train of General Otto von Reichart, and won renown for his surgical
skill with the successful amputation of the general’s leg after the fiasco
of Grim Hill. Today, Matthias is considered one of the finest surgeons in
the Empire, his services sought by the highest noblemen in the land.

A Skilful Scalpel: A wealthy nobleman has been injured and the
physician is called upon to attend him. He proclaims he was stabbed

story. The wounds look too precise, too accurate…leading the tending
physician to believe someone else skilled with a scalpel is responsible.
A Miracle Treatment: Rumours reach the characters, telling of a
radical medical procedure devised by a court physician in the employ
of a Border Prince. The rumours claim the court physician has found
a way to reattach severed limbs to a maimed person. When a local
baron’s son loses his arm in a tragic accident, he is willing to hire a

Quirks and Customs
Pilgrims of different faiths honour various customs when on pilgrimage.
Manann: Pilgrims of Manann transport jugs of saltwater over great
distances and subsist on diets of fish and dried seaweed. Dedicated
pilgrims drag heavy boat anchors behind them on ropes or chains.
Morr: Morr’s pilgrims travel in solemn processions to the Tilean city
of Remas, or wander in trancelike states searching for the fabled Tree of
Hope that is rumoured to exist somewhere beyond Morr’s realm.
Myrmidia: Soldiers of all nations embark on pilgrimages to Tilea and
Estalia for Myrmidia’s favour. During these journeys, pilgrims wear no
armour, only white robes stained with their own blood.
Ranald: Pilgrims of Ranald wear tokens signifying their dedication to
the covert Pilgrimage of Fingers (ToS, page 172). Examples include cat’s
paws, notched coin pendants and unusual piercings.
Shallya: The pilgrimage to the Shallyan high temple at Couronne in
Bretonnia is a selfless journey. Pilgrims survive on just water for days at
a time, passing on food donations to those truly in need.
Sigmar: The large trains of pilgrims that retrace Sigmar’s exodus from
the Empire attract considerable attention. Vendors of charms and scrolls
can make a tidy profit from these zealous trinket collectors.
Taal and Rhya: The Pilgrimage of the Stones (ToS, page 172) is
undertaken barefoot or topless, exposing the pilgrim to nature’s
elements. Winters are often spent meditating in a cave.
Ulric: Ulric’s pilgrims visit Middenheim to bask in the Sacred Flame
at the cathedral, or climb the highest peaks in the Middle Mountains.
They do not shave nor cut their hair, and many go unwashed.
Verena: Pilgrims of Verena are lone scholars who tour the greatest
libraries copying and distributing tomes of knowledge. They walk and
read at the same time, using head lanterns for illumination after dusk.
Completing Pilgrimages
Most pilgrims who reach their destinations return home afterwards,
though some immediately begin another, more ambitious pilgrimage.
Others spend their entire lives on the road. To some pilgrims, reaching
the destination is a reward in itself, while for others it is the journey.
Some pilgrims have experienced miracles or epiphanies upon arriving at
their goals.
The exact outcome of a pilgrimage depends on the level of divine
intervention preferred by the GM. Major outcomes might include
miraculous healing or the curing of insanity. Minor results can range
from meeting a helpful stranger to receiving prophetic dreams or
witnessing divine omens. Alternatively, successful pilgrims could receive
a bonus Fortune Point for their efforts.
Adventure Seeds
The Delivery: The pilgrim is given a letter to deliver by an eccentric
scholar. The letter is quite innocent, but a witch hunter from the
Sigmarite Order of the Flame suspects the scholar of blasphemous
writings. The pilgrim is shadowed by agents, and later along his journey
is mistaken for a collaborator.
An Annoying Addition: A naive sycophant insists on joining the
pilgrim’s journey. He is very helpful and dearly enamoured with the
pilgrim lifestyle, but lacks religious devotion. The pilgrim must decide
whether to shun his new friend, or allow him to tag along and risk
losing favour with his god.

Pistolier
Look what their damned arrows did to my doublet! Right chaps, let’s give ’em a taste of hot
lead. Charge!
(Core) Pistoliers are the elite light cavalry of the Imperial Army. They
specialize in wielding firearms, specifically pistols. Pistoliers have only come
into their own recently, as gunpowder weapons have been relatively unstable until
now in the Old World. Because of the expense of their weapons and the constant
upkeep that pistols and warhorses require, Noblemen dominate the ranks of the
Pistoliers. Many young Nobles volunteer for the Pistoliers in search of glory or
in the hopes of making a name.

The Pistolkorps
Pistoliers are skilled at taking the fight to the enemy with hit-and-run
attacks against the flanks of opposing armies. They are a magnificent
sight in their ostentatious livery and plumed helms as they charge
on swift steeds, pistols blazing. It is with great reluctance that most
pistoliers who survive their stint in the regiment trade the thrill and the
flair of the Pistolkorps for the austerity of a Knightly Order.
Most aspiring pistoliers join the ranks of the Pistolkorps, an Imperial
regiment of great distinction. Recruits are put under the wing of veteran
pistoliers who sport proudly waxed moustaches as a mark of their status.
These veterans are known as Outriders, because they can outride the
pistoliers under their command. They have close links with the School
of Engineers, allowing them to field new-fangled weapons such as
repeater handguns.
The Charge of Von Kleit’s Brigade
Von Kleit, the youngest of seven noble sons, escaped theological college
to form Von Kleit’s Flashpans, a regiment of pistoliers recruited from
among his daredevil friends. Vain, extravagant, and renowned for the
splendour of their uniforms, their lightning charges against enemy
flanks won them many victories.
Marius Leitdorf, Elector Count of Averland, pursued a campaign into
the Border Princes in retaliation for cattle raids of the robber baron
Heraclius Gasco. Von Kleit’s Flashpans joined the expedition, and Von
Kleit promised his men that the first to ‘beard the lion in his own den’
would win the pick of the spoils. Baron Gasco’s luxuriant whiskers were
infamous, so, armed with pistols in one hand and barber’s shears in the
other, the pistoliers unleashed an attack on the enemy lines.
Cannons roared, and the valley between the armies filled with
gunsmoke. The cheers of the pistoliers died in the obscuring fog. As the
echoes of cannon fire died away, a single victorious roar rang from the
direction of the enemy lines. Von Kleit emerged from the acrid smoke,
his uniform in tatters, his horse speeding him towards the stunned
baron. With a swift motion, he sheared Gasco’s beard, and with a
parting shot, planted a lead ball in the baron’s skull.
With the demise of their leader, the opposition retreated, but not before
a marksman shot Von Kleit as he returned to the cheering Imperial
lines. He fell clutching his trophy, a smile of triumph still on his face.
Adventure Seeds
An Old Comrade: A pistolier meets an old comrade from his regiment.
He is drunk, dishevelled, and dismissed from the army, falsely accused
of stealing the regimental seal. Can the pistolier help retrieve the seal
and clear his comrade’s name?
A Matter of Class: A regiment of pistoliers is newly stationed in a
small town. Loud and arrogant, they soon make enemies with the
adventurers. When the town is assaulted by orcs, competition between
the adventurers and pistoliers threatens its defence.
Special Rules
Outriders: The Outriders mentioned here are not the same as the
Outrider career class. Instead, they are a specialised type of Veteran. A
Pistolier can become an Outrider by becoming a Veteran and choosing
the following Talents: Mighty Shot, Rapid Reload, and Specialist
Weapon (Engineer). An Outrider is usually armed with an Engineer
weapon, such as a Repeater Firearm.

Pit Fighter
I am Gustaf the Mighty! Face me if you dare!
(Core) It is said that the sport of pit fighting has its origins amongst the Ogres. It is easy enough to
believe that a race as dim-witted as the Ogres would contribute fights to the death to the culture of
the Old World. In years past most Pit Fighters were criminals or prisoners of war. They’d be thrown in
a ring or a pit with a few weapons and only the winner would leave alive. These days there is a class
of professional Pit Fighters in addition to the condemned. They seek excitement and glory in the
pit, though most fight naught but a brutal death as the crowd howls for their blood. Successful Pit
Fighters can become wealthy (from prize money and the rampant gambling that surrounds the sport),
allowing slave fighters to buy their freedom.

The Secret Guild
Even though pit fighting is a sport found in most parts of the Empire, it
is loosely organised at best. Usually, it consists of local fighters gathering
together to provide a night’s entertainment, with the occasional
appearance by out-of-town opponents. In some of the larger cities,
leagues and permanent arenas are sometimes formed, though always
under the sufferance of local authorities or the control of local crime
bosses. However, it is still rare for any meaningful organisation of pit
fighters to exist. In fact, such an organisation seems at odds with the
very nature of throwing two men into a pit to hack each other to death.
Despite all this, however, rumours persist of an underground fellowship
of fighters. This secret pit fighter guild is rumoured to wield a surprising
amount of power and holds d influence with Imperial citizens right up
into the highest levels of government.
The goals of the guild, however, are unknown, though some speculate
that they are secretly training an army through endless matches and
bouts, covertly grooming dangerous fighters for their own ends. Getting
into the guild is as simple as making a name in the pit. They say the
best fighters are eventually approached and offered a chance to be part
of something bigger than themselves. Of course,since no one ever talks
about the guild its existence remains only rumour.
Notable Figures
Pit fighting has spawned some truly infamous individuals throughout
the Empire, such as Ogrim Fleshbiter with his taste for his opponent’s
fingers, or Horst the Slaughterer who throws his foes’ limbs into the
crowd. None, however, are quite as notorious or widely known as the
fighter who calls himself Fist. A mysterious figure, Fist is a topic from
the blood rings of Hesselbad to the canal arenas of Marienburg. They
say he is a fighter without peer and has never been defeated. He travels
from town to town and city to city, seeking new opponents to test his
skills.
When a champion has defeated a certain number of foes he will attract
Fist’s attention. Then it is only a matter of time before the mysterious
challenger will arrive. Nobody knows what Fist looks like, and there are
various wild tales as to his race and appearance.
Some say he is a vindictive ogre from the far east, come to show the
lesser races the true meaning of pit fighting. Others speculate that he is
not alive at all. Instead he is an undead construct made from the parts
of countless other fighters, held together with dark magic.
Adventure Seeds
Guarding the Best: Krass the Bloodied has long held the title of King
of the Pit in Middenhiem and has a dire reputation for his brutal, if
somewhat unsubtle, style in the pit. However, it his title draws some
unwanted attention outside the pit from would-be challengers. With a
big match tomorrow the fighter wants to stay out of trouble. So he is
looking for some bodyguards to do his fighting for him.
Substitute Needed: It seems the mayor of Riens has a dark past as a
champion of the pit and has made many enemies in the arena. Now
an old rival has returned, keen to settle a score. Eager to avoid both
embarrassment and grievous injury, the mayor is looking for someone
to fight in his stead.

(Core) While the Nobles are nominally “in charge” of most of the Old World’s countries, it is
the Politicians who actually run the villages, towns, and cities of the Empire. They are an often
reviled and frequently corruptible lot whose ranks include burgomeisters, mayors, and other civil
servants. Some are elected to their positions, while others are appointed. Politicians frequently
find themselves between various dangerous factions and have to swiftly become skilled at the fine
art of compromise. They are experts at saying exactly what people want to hear, though if they
actually follow through on their promises, it’s a minor miracle.

Politicians in the City
Civil servants who run things for nobles—that’s a common view of
politicians, but it’s incomplete. Politicians can fulfil a wide variety
of roles. They can be useful sources of employment, as they need to
get things done (or at least appear so). They’re useful as sources of
information, as their nature keeps their ears to the ground. They’re also
quite often handy behind-the-scenes villains for a longer campaign.
Lastly, politicians are often in need of guards while travelling, as their
gifts for talking won’t often deter highwaymen or cutpurses or rival
agitators and demagogues.
Hugo Stewardally
Born the fourteenth child of a farming family in the Moot, Hugo was
marked as different from birth with mismatched blue and brown eyes.
The sickly halfling learned herbalism and natural medicines from his
grandmother. She also taught him how to use people’s expectations to
his best advantage and how to listen.
Hugo left the Moot to become an Averheim tradesman, producing and
selling herbal remedies. Word of his skills and the quality of his wares
improved his fortunes. Before he turned 30, he opened the first nonhuman-owned
apothecary in Nuln. By the time he was 40, he owned
nine shops across two Imperial provinces, recruiting many siblings to
run his shops for him.
Hugo’s skill at constructing friendships across many races and
nationalities became his greatest strength. The seemingly-innocent
halfling had a knack for both knowing how to react and who to listen
to on most occasions. He also easily made the right friends at the right
times and places.
Hugo’s political interests began long before his career as a politician.
His constant trade conflicts with bigoted guildmasters or nobles led
him to stand up for nonhuman interests. After taking the time to study
Imperial law and improve his public speaking, Hugo began using his
contacts, his friends, and his clients to forge strong political ties among
them. Hugo’s work resulted in his becoming the focal representative of
numerous dwarven and halfling business interests across the southern
Empire.
Hugo remains in Nuln today, while he owns and oversees his seven
herbalists’ shops and twelve apothecaries spread across the Moot,
Stirland, Wissenland, and Averland. His success provides him the
freedom to act as the spokesperson for many less fortunate demihuman
factions—businesses, guilds, or whole communities. Hugo has
represented folk normally unable to broker trade deals with Nuln’s
ruling nobles or major trade councils and he has even agented deals
for others in Altdorf on more than one occasion. While many still
underestimate Hugo for his charming smile and smaller-than-average
size, they don’t do so twice.

Prelate
The temple roof is leaking, the dog tongs have gone missing –again – and Lord Grüber has invited me to another

(New) Every popular religious cult wields at least some degree of political influence. Priests who
represent their temples on town councils can – given enough ambition – attain special titles in
the court of the ruling noble, or become administrators of temple-owned lands. A prelate’s skill at
delivering sermons and debating legal statutes with equal proficiency makes him highly respected
in both civic and religious circles. However, the lure of temporal wealth and power has led
many prelates down the path of corruption. Prelates may also be known as vicars, curates or
arch lectors, depending upon the cult.

Manann: Prelates of Manann control the port authorities in many
coastal towns and are expected to have mercantile contacts in
Marienburg. They sometimes command small contingents of Sons of
Manann (see Tome of Salvation page 34) who protect local ships from
pirates.
Morr: The eccentric priests of Morr favour mysticism over politics,
so prelates in the cult are rare. However, in Tilea and the eastern
Empire, the Order of the Shroud is often embroiled in council debates
concerning undead threats.
Myrmidia: Prelates of Myrmidia are almost unheard of in the Empire,
where Ulric’s and Sigmar’s priests occupy the seats of political-religious
power. In Tilea and Estalia, however, nearly every major noble has a
prelate of Myrmidia accompanying his army.
Ranald: Some Ranaldan priests who attain the rank of prelate operate
undercover within the Merchants’ Guild, acting on behalf of The
Brotherhood. Others lead the Thieves’ Guild on behalf of the Givers of
Coin whilst hiding behind innocuous public identities.
Shallya: Shallya’s ascetic priestesses do not aspire to political gain, and
therefore prelates are uncommon. During particularly virulent plague
epidemics, however, nobles may dispatch a Shallyan prelate to Bretonnia
for liaisons with the cult’s matriarch in Couronne.
Sigmar: The Empire contains many Sigmarite prelates of the Torch
(usually called lectors or capitulars) who report to the Grand Theogonist
in Altdorf. Prelates from the Order of the Silver Hammer lead bands of
religious warriors around the Empire to protect its borders and advise
rural nobles.
Taal and Rhya: Prelates are rare in the priesthood of Taal and Rhya,
which tends to eschew politics. Nevertheless, the ruling councils of
predominantly agricultural towns may include a prelate representing the
Bringers of Bounty (see Tome of Salvation page 64).
Ulric: Many of Ulric’s deputy high priests, called denfathers, are
prelates, particularly in the northern towns where Ulric’s cult enjoys the
greatest political influence. Prelates of Ulric are expected to maintain
contact with the high temple in Middenheim.
Verena: Verenan prelates of the Scalebearer order may work as
magistrates in town courts or advisors at the Imperial courts where
Sigmarite law is practiced. Prelates of the Lorekeeper order are highly
sought after by nobles to serve as court scholars.
Special Talent: Divine Inspiration
A prelate can invoke the power of his god for assistance when fulfilling
his god’s sacred tenets. A prelate gains a bonus Fortune Point each day.
This can only be used to reroll a Skill Test based on the special skills
related to his cult. Alternatively, a GM may allow the prelate to use this
bonus Fortune Point to re-roll any Skill Test made to uphold or follow
his god’s strictures. See WFRP Chapter VIII: Religion & Belief for
details on each holy order’s skills and strictures.
Adventure Seeds
A Challenge of Faith: The tradition-bound priests of the order
are quashing more progressive sects, occasionally using violence. An
excommunicated splinter sect needs someone with enough political
savvy to challenge the local priesthood at the cult’s high courts. But first,

Priest
I am but a vessel for the will and wont of the gods. All I do, I do at their behest.
(Core) Priests are ordained men and women who administer to the needs of the faithful throughout
the Old World. Their Gods gift them with the ability to channel small amounts of divine energy, to
aid in their works. Many Priests will be assigned to a specific region or church, others are wanderers
who go where they feel they can do the most good. The receptions they get are directly linked to
their deity. A Priestess of Shallya is likely to be received warmly no matter where she goes, whereas a
Priest of Ulric is likely to only be heartily welcomed when a great battle is in the offing.

Sacred Work
From morning prayer to evensong, a priest’s day is long and laborious.
After all, work is worship and idleness a mortal sin. After matins, a
hundred chores await the priest, from tending the altar fires to toiling in
the temple’s fields or gardens.
The worst of the drudgery can be passed down to the initiates, allowing
time for important tasks, such as writing sermons or preparing lessons
(the education of the initiates is another responsibility). Prayer and
ritual infuse everything a priest does, and he must drop everything
when the temple bell summons him to worship. The the only relaxation
he receives is during a few hours snatched for private study before
evening devotions.
Sometimes a priest is allowed to escape the rigours of temple life
to wander among his parishioners, offering prayers, guidance, and
arbitrating their disputes. Bringing the god’s blessing to the community
is an important function.
On feast days, worshippers flock to the temple to partake in the sacred
rites and sermons, and the priests must tend to their spiritual needs. A
priest should always remember that he is a servant not only of his god,
but also of his congregation.
Father Reiser’s Grave Vow
Some priests take the wandering vow, inspired to leave their temple
and spread their faith abroad. A celebrated wandering priest is Father
Tancred Reiser who, from the day of his Initiation into the Order of the
Shroud, vowed he would never rest until he had bestowed Morr’s grace
on every lost corpse and forgotten grave in the Empire.
This black-robed devotee of the Lord of Death travels ceaselessly, shovel
on shoulder, searching for the burial places of lost souls untouched by
Morr’s final blessing.
Some say that the crow accompanying him can see the shades of the
restless dead weeping above their graves, wailing for Morr’s solace, and
leads Father Reiser to them. Indeed, wherever the priest stops to spade
the ground, he unearths old bones. These he reburies with the ritual
they deserve.
It is Reiser’s belief that a corpse thus blessed will never rise again,
and his lonely wanderings are a one-man crusade against the evils of
necromancy. However, so many forgotten dead are buried beneath
the Empire’s soil that, in ten years of wandering, the priest has not yet
ventured beyond thirty miles of his home temple.

Protagonist
You want him busted up good, or just scared? I charge the same either way, just wondering how far you want this to go.
(Core) Protagonists are professional bullies. Their fighting skills are for hire and they will beat up just about anyone
for the right price. In many cases, Protagonists hide the fact that they are hired help, making up ridiculous excuses to
start a brawl with the chosen target. The moneyman watches the humiliation of his foe, for enjoyment or profit of both.
Roughing up a few locals is comparatively cheap, while more formidable opponents and more grievous injuries are
proportionally more expensive. Most leave outright murder to the Assassins, but exceptions to this rule can be purchased.
Jobless Protagonists simply pick their own fights and rob their victims. Needless to say, Watchmen keep a close eye on
known Protagonists, so they tend to move quickly from place to place.

A Day in the Life
A protagonist begins work by frequenting the more violent local dives.
He will put the word out to a local fence that he is willing to brawl
for money. Sooner or later a paying customer, or fence acting as a
middleman, approachs the protagonist.
They will debate the contract, agree on a price and discuss any
complications. Some protagonists might need to be persuaded that it is
ethical to attack their target, though most feel no need to justify their
bold actions.
It is usually towards the end of the night, after a few drinks are downed,
that the Protagonist plies his trade. He will pick his mark, either a
pre-arranged target or just someone who looks like he might be carrying
money. He contrives some pretext for a disagreement, a spilt drink or
insulting remark. The protagonist will then do all he can to exacerbate
the argument and ‘justify’ his assault. He will then either collect his fee,
rob his victim, or both.
A good protagonist will be able to keep this up for some time,
explaining to the authorities (who usually have something more
important to worry about) that he was ‘just minding his own business’
when he was unnecessarily provoked. However, most protagonists
make enemies quickly, and have to stay on the move in order to stay
one step ahead of revenge.
Affiliations
If a protagonist intends to work in a given area for any length of time
it will be to his advantage to get to know the local watch, and cultivate
contacts with the criminal underworld. Protagonists can bribe, cajole,
or threaten watchmen into turning a blind eye to his activities, or even
going along with his protestations of innocence and getting his victims
into further trouble for ‘starting things.’ This is a dangerous game for
the protagonist. If his bribes or threats reach the ears of an incorruptible
Watchman he will likely be dealt with harshly.
Underworld contacts such as fences provide work and a safe place to
hide should the Protagonist need it. A crime lord who fancies a minion
with a little more flair than a common thug might even offer the
protagonist regular employment.
Adventure Seeds
An Unexpected Turn: A shifty individual approaches a protagonist
with a simple task, give a man standing at the bar a bloody nose. Within
minutes the protagonist is accusing the man of spilling ale over his new
boots, and mashes his nose to a pulp. However, it is not blood that
spews forth, but thick black tar. The man is exposed as a mutant and the
protagonist hailed as a hero, but the shifty individual has vanished. Just
why was the protagonist hired to expose the mutant in this manner?
The Price of Blood: The protagonist bumped into an easy mark in
the tavern last night, a chinless weakling with an irritating manner
and dressed in ridiculous clothes. As luck would have it a brawl broke
out and the protagonist used it as cover to beat the man senseless and
lift his purse, so full of gold, the protagonist will be able to live off the
contents for weeks. Later on that day his friends deliver some bad news.
His victim was the son of a visiting noble lord who is now offering
a generous sum of money to find out who beat him so badly. The
protagonist had better skip town quickly before someone sells him out.

Questing Knight
Has thou seen or heard of the Grail? I’ve ridden a fortnight to find out what you know.
(KotG) Questing Knights seek the Grail. Following in the footsteps of Louis the Rash, they cross
Bretonnia and the rest of the world, seeking the blessing of the Lady of the Lake. Those knights who have
succeeded in their quest have met the Lady in a variety of places, so the quest is not
a search for a place. Rather, it is an effort to prove oneself worthy of the Grail. Thus,
Questing Knights strive to show themselves to be paragons of knighthood, seeking out
dangerous situations in which to uphold the honour of Bretonnia and the Lady of the
Lake.
Questing Knights renounce the use of the lance because it is the weapon of loyal
service, and a Questing Knight stands apart from the feudal hierarchy until his
quest is complete.

A Day In The Life
The questing knight lives on the road, accompanied by his loyal squire
who prepares his food while the knight cares for his weapons and says
his morning prayers to the Lady of the Lake.
A knight who knows of worthy challenge immediately sets off to face
it, and much of his day consists of heroic battle against overwhelming
odds, upholding the honour of knighthood and Bretonnia. He may find
himself patching wounds and resting for several days thereafter.
Those looking for their next challenge wander as the whim takes them.
They are sometimes guided by visions from the Lady of the Lake, but
these are not always forthcoming. Such knights speak to any nobles
they meet, and have their squires speak to peasants, asking for rumours
of monsters, beastmen, or greenskins. Many rumours prove to be
nothing more than that, but sometimes the knight finds a challenge
while chasing an empty rumour. In any case, one direction is as good as
another, and the knight should never waste his time in idleness.
As members of the Bretonnian nobility, questing knights can demand
food from any peasants they meet. As they are trying to be paragons of
chivalry, questing knights try not to ask more than a peasant can afford.
Of course, most questing knights are completely ignorant of the realities
of peasant life, and thus often get this wrong.
Sir Panteleon The Old
Sir Panteleon is in his late fifties, and has been a questing knight for
almost thirty years. His reputation is second to none, and knights,
ladies, and peasants across the whole of Bretonnia sing the praises of
his great deeds. He single-handedly slew an orcish warband in the
mountains of Carcassone, saved villages from beastmen in the Forest of
Arden, and shattered the fortress of a necromancer in Mousillon.
Through all this, he has been denied the vision of the Lady and the
honor of drinking from the Grail that would promote him to the
position of Grail Knight. Rumours that he is not truly of noble birth,
not truly Bretonnian, or actually a woman have been circulating for
years, and many people now believe that “he” is actually a disguised
Tilean woman, an ex-prostitute. Sir Panteleon himself has no idea why
he is denied the vision, but sees no reason to abandon the quest.
Adventure Seeds
A Pawn in a Dangerous Game: After following rumours of corrupt
knights and foul beasts, the questing knight realises that most of his
quests have benefited one particular noble. The knight has fought
the noble’s enemies and defeated monsters threatening his lands. The
possibility that he has been manipulated must be faced, as must the
question of the noble’s motives in abusing the knight’s Grail Quest.
A Delightful Dance: The knight uncovers a grave threat to Bretonnia
and the honour of its nobles. A new dance has come into vogue and is
swiftly becoming a most-popular pastime, especially amongst those of
high birth. A few learned men have begun to whisper of the possibility
that some dark force is encouraging the spread of this bizzare dance, yet
they have no proof. They need a resourceful knight to take up a quest to
uncover the truth behind this latest fashion. Is it a harmless amusement,
or the beginings of a terrible ritual linked to a cult of Slannesh? The
questing knight may need his social charms more than his sword to get
his answers.

Racketeer
We live in a dangerous world, Siegfried. I’d hate to see anything... happen... to that new shop you opened up.
(Core) Racketeers make up the general ranks of most criminal organisations. They are experts at extorting
protection money from small businesses, which tends to be their most lucrative operation. Successful
Racketeers move into such activities as loan sharking, drug pedalling, prostitution and illegal gambling dens.
They are seldom very imaginative, insofar as criminals go, but they are generally ruthless and used to having
their own way. Racketeers are sometimes even a part of the local government, which makes rooting them
out a very tricky business for law enforcement. In some areas, they are the local law enforcement.

Rudiger Taalburg / “Digger”
Rudiger Taalburg knows how to profit from his size and muscles. He
was a Wissenland village bully until local nobles hired him as a guardian
for their youngest boy. Despite being better fed and clothed than ever
before, Rudiger grew bored spending all his time with the muchyounger
Siegfried Bremel.
A bodyguard for ten years, Rudiger kept Siegfried safe from the
repercussions of bullying others with his money and social status.
The young Lord Bremel’s arrogance made many enemies Rudiger was
forced to deal with. When Siegfried came of age and moved on to
other exploits, he let his oldest personal servant into his secret—he
undermined Lord Magnus Bremel’s orderly local rule with his growing
criminal enterprises. It took little convincing to move Rudiger into life
as a racketeer.
By day Rudiger Taalburg acts as the personal bodyguard of Lord
Siegfried Bremel, brother to the local liege lord. By night, he becomes
“Digger,” the mouthpiece for “Imrak Karkhazhof.” Rudiger enjoys the
added money, excitement, and women that come with this illicit facet of
his long-time job, and has come to enjoy showing others how he earned
his moniker by finding an appropriate plot to dig up and dispose of
those who attempt to stand up to his racket.
The Karkhazhof League
This group of racketeers, extortionists, highwaymen, and conmen
control illicit activities in a variety of small, forgettable towns in
Wissenland. Known criminals began disappearing, much to the relief of
the locals, until the activity continued with new faces all talking about
mandatory membership in the Karkhazhof League. Some commonfolk
assume by the name that Grey Mountain dwarves might be at the heart
of this.
Coach robbery rarely happens on roads among these towns – though
folk who forego League protection often vanish between towns, along
with all goods and coaches. Many businesses among these villages see
greater trade these days, thanks to the League – but those who don’t
pay extortions lose goods or teeth, if not trading partners. Local law
enforcement seldom captures League associates – since the League keeps
select militia paid off with prostitutes and bribes.
In secret, the League is the shadow of House Bremel’s business networks
in southern Wissenland. Lord Siegfried Bremel is the much-rumoured
but never seen “Imrak Karkhazhof” whose orders funnel through his
eight lieutenants using ever-changing and discreet communications
(hired messengers, hunters, outlaws, and vagabonds). Each lieutenant
controls one aspect of League activity in one town, and none strives for
more. The last greedy lieutenant grabbing for power ended up hanging
by his own entrails outside a tavern over a year ago. Siegfried enjoys his
game, both for the illicit profits and as the secret goad in the side of his
lawful elder brother whose knights he easily leads astray.

Raconteur
Hah, hah…yes, your daughter you say? Well…I’m sure this is all a misunderstanding. In fact,
it reminds me of a tale…
(SH) Born with a gift of gab and a desire to use it, Raconteurs are natural storytellers
who can be found in taverns, inns, and salons anywhere in the Empire. No matter what
the occasion – or even if it’s no occasion at all – the Raconteur has a ready story. He travels
from place to place, witnessing marvellous things and weaving a thrilling tale about it all.
In a society in which most people cannot read, the Raconteur is both a source of news and
entertainment, mixing witty repartee and cutting wit into his stories. To gain his news, a
Raconteur might find himself travelling with armies and adventuring bands in the hope of
seeing (and surviving) something new and exciting, something that will earn him a few rounds of
drinks and a healthy audience at the local inn. Not all Raconteurs enjoy the adventurous life,
however. Some stay comfortably where they are and make it all up.

The Famous Brotherhood of Adventurers,
Explorers and Gentlemen (The Liars’ Guild)
Once a week at the Five Feathers inn, the Famous Brotherhood (or
as most people call it – the Liars’ Guild) meets up. This gathering of
raconteurs, rogues and entertainers is an occasion for world famous
adventurers to relate thrilling tales of their unlikely, extraordinary and
lurid exploits. Of course, no one takes these “adventurers” seriously. The
Famous Brotherhood is entirely performance and is perhaps the finest
dinner theatre available to common folk in the Empire. Over cheap
beer, hard bread and sheep stew, an audience can enjoy outlandish tales
of wit, wonder, warfare and womanising. It seems harmless enough fun.
But occasionally, the Famous Brotherhood will invite an actual
adventurer to speak – someone who really has done something
extraordinary. Paid at most a few shillings, and promised the
opportunity to share their fabulous exploits, these speakers rarely know
what they’re in for. The crowd is merciless to these invited guests. Easily
bored, surly and often drunk, the audience expects non-stop ribald
comedy and lurid action. The raconteur regulars know this and excel
at entertaining the crowd. Some stoic dwarf there to tell tales of his
troll-slaying probably does not. If he is not careful, he may soon have to
dodge a deluge of rotten vegetables, bread rinds and half-chewed sheep
bones.
Etienne Legrand
This legendary storyteller and heartbreaker is both beloved and hated in
the inns where he frequents. He is loved for his fine tales full of fancy
and lyricism, and hated for his womanising and wife-stealing. More
than one distressed bride has run away to be with her “Dear Sweet
Etienne” only to discover her paramour missing and her reputation
ruined.
In truth, Etienne is more than he seems and, by the way, not at all
Bretonnian. Once an agitator, Eckhart Lang incited a vicious series of
uprisings in Nuln, that ended in the death of more than a few peasants
and watchmen, along with a corrupt viscount. Eckhart, realising that he
had finally gone too far, fled the city and changed his name, adopting
the persona of Etienne. Still, old habits die hard; Etienne continues
to believe that the aristocracy of the empire should be brought down.
Sleeping with their pretty wives and mistresses is just one way of getting
revenge.
Adventure Seeds
Hiding in Plain Sight: Etienne has finally jilted the wrong woman.
His beautiful, sweet Angelique has hired a band of thugs to kill the
raconteur. Now he has only chance of escape – to disguise himself as
one of the adventurers he met earlier at the tavern, in the hope that the
thugs will tangle with the wrong man.
Fool Me Once...: A raconteur decides that the characters’ last
adventure is worthy of a farce. He begins telling mostly inaccurate
versions of the characters’ exploits that make them appear as buffoons.
His stories are incredibly well received and soon enough a would-be
playwright contacts our heroes. The hack wants to write a comic play
about their tales. Of course, when they learn exactly what he thinks
they’ve done, they may not be so amused.

Rapscallion
The night is still young, friends. There’s at least three or four more hours ‘til daybreak. What shall we do next?
(New) Some young men have a certain charm to them. They aren’t necessarily wealthy but
they know how to wear clothes well, to make themselves look good in a dashing and slightly
unconventional way. They’re clever, quick, and a little dangerous, like a young cat just come into
its full growth and proud of its own speed and claws. Rapscallions are not thieves, though they
may steal. They are not duellists, though they may fight duels. They are not scholars, though
they may be well-read. What they are is young men with style and grace and flair who like
to be in the thick of things. A Rapscallion lives for action, for excitement, and his presence
tends to energize others. He can be an excellent ally, a dangerous enemy, or merely a short
distraction, but one thing is certain—a Rapscallion is always memorable

A Day in the Life
Rapscallions have no daily routine, though they do have regular habits.
That is, a rapscallion has no fixed occupation and so does not do the
same work from day to day, but he may have certain personal habits
that remain consistent.
Most rapscallions rise late – this is, after all, one of the great advantages
to not holding a steady job. After waking, a rapscallion always washes
and grooms himself – one thing every rapscallion (even the scruffy ones)
takes pride in is looking his best. Once ready for the day, the rapscallion
sallies forth, most often to a favourite tavern. There he breaks his fast,
greets friends, listens to gossip and waits to see what shape the day will
take. Rarely does a rapscallion sit idle for long – something is always
happening somewhere, and before long he cannot control himself and
must leap into whatever fray he can find.
If nothing presents itself quickly enough, the rapscallion may leave
the tavern behind and take to the streets, particularly the markets and
bazaars. These are often abuzz with activity, and so he can lose himself
in the frenzy of activity, finding something to entertain him. Often a
rapscallion selects a visitor and offers his services as a guide, knowing
these strangers are the most likely targets for thieves, thugs and worse.
Anyone who looks lost, confused, or frightened attracts the rapscallion’s
attention because they may provide interest and activity.
Most rapscallions have several places they frequent – a particular tavern,
a section of the bazaar, a spot along the docks, a seamstress’s or tailor’s
shop – and will visit each of those places each day, if only to see and
be seen. At the same time, rapscallions are always up for carousing
anywhere, anytime, with anyone, and so at a moment’s notice they
might abandon all previous plans and hie to another bar or event. Only
someone in immediate danger is enough to keep a rapscallion focused
on the troubles at hand.
Rapscallions often find themselves asleep in another’s bed, and so
their nights hardly fall into a routine. When not out partying and
not entertaining a companion, most rapscallions actually sleep early,
recharging for whatever the next day might bring.
Little Known Facts
Many, but not all, rapscallions are noble-born and have money. These
individuals often live under a false name to keep their exploits from
embarrassing their family – or more likely keep their family from
cutting off their purse strings.
Rapscallions are both loved and hated, and often by the same people.
They are charming, friendly, foolhardy and eager to help – and they
blunder into matters they know nothing about, often endangering not
only themselves but everyone else nearby with their enthusiasm.
Rich young noblemen often disguise themselves and slum about in
the poorer, rougher parts of a city, seeking excitement and anonymity.
These are not true rapscallions, however. They value their own hides too
much, and think about money too often. A true rapscallion is there for
excitement and adventure first and foremost, and thinks little of risking
his own neck if he gets involved.
Adventure Hook
 A Woman in Peril: A lovely young lady walks into the tavern. She
glances behind her, clearly frightened of someone—or something. How
could any young man resist the urge to introduce himself and offer to
shield her from whatever evil stalks her?

Rat Catcher
If you grabs them by the tails, they can’t barely even bite you. Well, not most of the time.
(Core) The Rat Catcher is a common sight throughout the Empire. They can be found in villages, towns,
and cities, making a living by disposing of the vermin that infest all dwellings in this unsanitary age.
Rat Catchers are often travelling folk, although larger towns and cities have permanent contingents of
“vermin soldiers.” Rats are their chief enemy, but they can also dispose of moles, mice, and even fouler
pests. City-dwelling Rat Catchers spend a great deal of time in the sewers, wading through rivers of filth
in search of their prey. It’s a dirty job but it helps keep the plague away.

The Secret of Catching Rats
A good rat catcher keeps his methods secret if he wants to protect
his livelihood. He prefers if his customers attribute his skills to some
supernatural talent, rather than a collection of clever tricks. However,
a good rat catcher doesn’t catch many rats chasing after them with a
mallet. To truly excel at the art of hunting and killing vermin a rat
catcher must become a true rat wrangler, truly understanding the rat.
To this end, rat catchers sometime spend hours in sewers and derelict
buildings sitting silently and watching their prey, learning how they
move, hunt, and feed.
The most common way to catch rats is to trap a house. The rat catchers
find the likely places rats travel and lay simple cage or spring traps to
kill or capture them. However, sometimes canny rats will learn to avoid
or even survive the traps. Then, the rat catcher must hunt them down.
Rats leave many traces of their passing, from tiny paw prints to trails of
droppings. A good rat catcher can tell the size and gender of a rat by its
tracks. A rat catcher’s dog is also a vital part of his trade and it is during
the hunt that it comes into the fore. A dog can crawl into dark places
and root out hidden vermin. He is also the rat catcher’s nose, helping
him to detect the scent of filth left by his quarry.
Rat Catcher Slang
Living beneath the notice of society, rat catchers are a rather secretive
and shadowy group, prefering the company of their own kind. Part of
this insular nature comes out in the way they speak, a mixture of slang
and trade tongue that only other rat catchers truly understand. Below
are a few examples of rat catcher slang.
Rats – Tunnel Pigeons, Sewer Bunnies, Pox with Paws, Privy Natives
Sewer – Filth Hole, Dark Street, Rubbish Pipe, Rat Run, Downtown
Job – Rat Hunt, Trap and Strangle, Underground Walk
Money – Rat Tails, Sewer Coin, Skull and Paw
Watchman – Clanker, Limping Lantern, Signpost
City – Rat Wheel, Sewer Top
Person – Stinker, Walking Filth, Rubbish Farmer
Bad Smells – Grey Air, Sewer Fragrance, Morr’s Fart, Privy Perfume
So for example a rat catcher might say he was on a trap and strangle in
the filth hole when he noticed some vile privy perfume. However the
rubbish farmer was paying good rat tails so he decided to get on and
find the cursed tunnel pigeon.
Adventure Seeds
Annual Running of the Rats: Each year the rat catchers and sewer
jacks of Altdorf hold a great running of the rats in the city’s sewers.
Huge fires are lit at key points in the sewers (carefully supervised, of
course!) to drive a sweeping torrent of rats out into the open, where
brave souls will see how many they can snare. However, often the
fires stir more than just rats and participants may get more than they
bargained for.
Too Little of a Bad Thing: Frensburg has an unusual rat problem –
there are no rats anywhere in the town! The local rat catchers are unable
to find any trace of the vile vermin and no one knows why they have
gone away. Far from being pleased, the residents are now quite worried
and are hoping for the return of the rats so everything can return to
normal.

Blood and terror! For the glory of the Plague Lords!

and the feeble militias that stand against them. Reavers sail the seas to bring
booty back to their settlements in their frozen lands. Others sell their souls to the

A Day in the Life
The life of a reaver is tightly woven to the ship he works on, and the
long days often start as the reavers guide the vessel through the fierce
northern seas. Breakfast is gulped down in a corner that gives some
protection from the wind, and normally washed down with strong
spirits to keep a fire in his belly. Unless some prey is sighted, the day
continues as it began, until the reaver has the chance to eat an evening
meal and tie himself in to grab some sleep.
 However, once a suitable target is spotted, whether it is a ship or a
coastal village, everything changes. The reavers quickly bring the ship
around to fall upon their target at full speed, seeking gain the element
of surprise and overwhelm their opponent quickly. As they approach,
the bare minimum of men are assigned to continue crewing the vessel,
while everyone else gears for battle and readies weapons.
When the ship comes close, reavers leap from their deck straight into
the action, charging in with battle cries and cutting down any who
stand in their way. Even those who try to flee are chased down; reavers
enjoy their bloody work and seldom leave survivors.
Once everyone is dead, or fled, the reavers gather their loot. Valuables
are stored in the hold of their ship, while food and drink is consumed
in great celebratory feasts. The crew sets out again from land, out of the
reach of those who might seek revenge. Once back on the seas, many of
the reavers who participated in the raid drink themselves into a mighty
stupor, which may last until the next raid.
Hildr
Hildr is a rarity, a female reaver. She is a beauty, with long blonde hair
and a feminine figure that belies her strength. Some whisper that she is
actually blessed of the Ruinous Powers, and bears a mark of their favour
somewhere on her lithe body, but she does not claim that glory.
She enjoys challenging the most stalwart opponents on the battlefield
to single combat. Her victims rise to the challenge, since many
would be dishonoured or horribly shamed to admit they had balked
when confronted by a mere woman. But the victory notches on her
fearsome twin-bladed axe Maiden’s Kiss count dozens of men for whom
discretion would have been the better part of valour.
Adventure Seeds
A Lone Reaver: During a raid on a coastal settlement, a reaver pursues
a merchant laden with jewellery, whose speed belies his appearance.
The chase takes some time, and after killing his victim and taking the
treasure, it takes the reaver a long time to get back to the site of the raid,
loaded down as he is. When he does get back, the ship has sailed, and
Imperial troops have arrived in the village to investigate the disturbance.
Will the lone reaver be apprehended? Can he find his way home?
Unexpected Resistance: A reaver and his companions descend on an
apparently defenceless village, and start their bloody business. They cut
their way to the centre of the village, when the dead stand up behind
them, and zombies pour out of the buildings, in staggering numbers,
surround the raiders. One of the reavers recalls an old wive’s tale of
a powerful relic hidden somewhere in the village ripe for plunder –
should the reavers survive.

Riverwarden
Rocking the Boat
The best riverwardens need to use a bit of subtlety and common sense.
They could go searching every nook of every vessel that comes down the
river, and they’d be sure to find a lot of good stuff. And they’d be sure
to end up with no friends, if they were lucky, and a knife in the back if
they were not.
A good riverwarden needs to be a friend to the boatmen, not their
enemy. He needs to get to know them and learn their ways. It’s best for
both parties. There’s plenty of opportunity to catch foreign smugglers
and ne’er do wells, the sorts that don’t understand folk on this stretch
of the river.
The honest local boatman, might smuggle a bit, he’s got to, really, but
nothing too much, nothing that will inconvenience the duke, or bring
the Empire down. And if you know where to look, or more to the
point, where not to look, a good riverwarden will find plenty to keep
him busy: the odd bottle of brandy, or wheel of cheese, or leg of ham,
that needs to be confiscated, without rocking the boat, so to speak.
The Battle of Bechbad
The town of Bechbad on the Talabec, a couple of days downriver from
Talabheim, had always been quite quiet. The riverwardens there had
little to do but check the regular flow of cargo ships making their way
up and down the great river.
Until, the pirates came. In a couple of weeks, five cargoes were lost
and many honest boatmen. The Bechbad riverwardens could do little;
and caught no sight of he pirates, who had any number of sheltered
tributaries and secluded inlets to hide in.
Then the captain of the riverwardens commandeered a cargo boat. He
grabbed the next suitable ship, and demanded volunteers from the
townsfolk and crews that were resting in Bechbad. And so filled with
vigilantes and riverwardens, the boat made its way up the river.
They were soon set upon by the pirates and battle was joined. The
struggle saw the pirate ship burn and sink and the commandeered vessel
was badly damaged. But eventually, all the pirates lay dead or captured.
And thanks to the brave men of the Bechbad riverwardens that stretch
of river has not seen another pirate to this very day.
Adventure Seeds
Looking the Other Way: The usually loyal riverwarden is approached
by some stranger to deliberately overlook a crate or two coming in
on the next boat. The crate is clearly described, and all the character
has to do is search a different one. The money he is offered to do so is
excellent. This is a test, however. The crate is entirely legitimate. If the
character passes the test, then next time he will be paid the same way
but the crate will be full of illicit goods. If he does not pass the test, the
boys will come round to ‘have a word.’
Greasing the Right Palm: The characers needs to get that thing down
the river without the authorities getting wind of it. They need to contact
a riverwarden and make sure they get away with it. Word on the bank is
that the riverwardens can be bribed but you have to know what you’re
doing. If the characters get it right, the river warden will get their crate
all the way to the destination for them without a sniff of trouble, but it
will cost them. If they get it wrong, it will cost them a lot more.
River Warden
And what’s this? Brandy, eh? Produce of Bretonnia. Just a single bottle. You’ve never seen it before
in your life? I’d better get it out the way, then, before someone trips on it. And, see you same time
next week.
(WC) A clarion call across the murky waters of the Reik can only mean one thing: Riverwardens.
These strong-backed lawmen are commonly perceived by river goers as little better than thugs, as
they must harass even innocent vessels when checking for smuggled goods and have learned that
politeness and trust do not pay off. The over-worked patrols, which toil through month-long shifts at
a time, are responsible for waters too large to be effectively controlled. They spend most of their time
concentrating on the worst law-breakers, including pirates, murderers, and barge thieves, and allow most
petty misdemeanours to slip by with spot-fines. They are a common sight on the rivers, and their patrols
extend as far as Kislev.
Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Riverwarden for
Roadwarden with your GM’s approval.

Watchers of the Road
Road wardens operate in small groups led by a sergeant, recruited from
fearless local men with intimate knowledge of wilderness surrounding
their communities. They patrol their stretch of road ceaselessly, always
on the watch for danger. Their base of operation are the inns that dot
the roads, and the innkeeper, grateful for their protection, is happy to
provide them with a bed, hot meal, and stabling for free.
Road warden groups serve under a captain, who is based in the nearest
town. He liaisons closely with the town watch, who are responsible for
delivering justice to the outlaws the captain’s men bring in. In more
remote areas, where Imperial control is light, road wardens adopt the
role of judge, jury, and executioner. The roadside inns are their court
and the trees at the forest’s edge their gallows, where the condemned are
left to hang as a warning to other renegades.
An important function of the road wardens is to carry news to the
scattered settlements along their patrol. They are the only face of the
Emperor’s justice these isolated communities might ever meet, and as
such are treated with great respect.
Road Wardens in Popular Literature
The sight of a road warden patrol is so ubiquitous on the roads of the
Empire that they have acquired an almost legendary status. Ballads are
sung around tavern fires extolling their virtues and deeds. With the
advent of the printing press, these stories endure within the pages of
cheap, popular chapbooks with titles such as Murder at a Dark House
and The Bride of Death. These tales enthrall rich and poor alike, the
illiterate crowding around a tavern hearth to hear a professional reader
recount the latest adventures.
The central figure of these chapbooks is the legendary Tod Schlachten,
a taciturn, ruggedly handsome hero who cuts a dashing figure in his
greatcoat and wide-brimmed hat atop his black steed, Celerus. In each
adventure he hounds his prey to justice, the aim of his pistol always
true. The stories always end with him spurning the advances of a
nobleman’s daughter he has rescued from the clutches of forest raiders.
Actual road wardens are flattered by this depiction. The perils described
in these stories are an everyday reality for them, though they bemoan
the fact that it is usually a fat merchant they are saving, and never a
buxom noble lady.

A Time For Revenge: A road warden patrol arrives on the scene of a
forest ambush, but the attackers still lurk among the trees, taking them
by surprise. Left for dead amongst the carnage, the lone survivor swears
he will not rest until he avenges his friends.
A Familiar Face: While stopping at an inn, a road warden recognises a
face among the patrons, It is a bandit who could lead him to an outlaw
chief who has long eluded his patrol. But the road warden discovers that
the leader of the outlaws is not the evildoer claimed by the authorities,
but a fighter against the injustices perpetrated against defenceless
commoners. Whose justice will the lawman decide to follow?

never realize it was a con.

The Ambassador
Salvatore Fiorenzo Bellarmini di Rosellino e Luccini came to Altdorf
one day with a flourish and an entourage. He revealed his credentials
to the town fathers and they were impeccable. He had come for one
reason – to be the ambassador to the Empire from the Tilean city state
of Luccini.
His first priority – announce himself to the Emperor. His second
priority – sell an exclusive trade monopoly between the Empire and
Luccini to the highest bidder. Handsome, worldly, and well-travelled,
he soon became the toast of Imperial society. There is only one problem.
He is not the ambassador. He is not even Tilean. He is a confidence
man and rogue.
Diego (that’s his real name – he’s Estalian) knows his time is short. It
is only a matter of time before he is discovered and his neck is on the
block. He plans to sell as many confidential and exclusive monopolies
as he can, hoard as much cash as possible, and then “report back to his
prince” (flee as quickly as possible). If anyone gets in his way, they are
going to discover that they are accused of threatening and trying to
murder the ambassador. Diego is not above letting innocent men hang
if it means he will make his fortune.
Dominik Guildenstern
Dominik is a rogue, but he is also a playwright, actor, and co-owner of a
small stage in Nuln. Alas, in these hard times, Dominik has been forced
to resort to unsavoury measures to keep his theatre in business. He has
borrowed money from a local crime lord who hopes to ‘foreclose’ on the
theatre and turn into a base for his thugs.
Dominik’s judgement is questionable, but not his talent. He has written
a play for the ages – The Prince of Palingarde. Dominik is possitive this
play will make his name. It has everything – love, revenge, murder,
romance and a bit with a dog. But he just can not seem to find the
financing to stage this elaborate production.
Thus, Dominik is looking for investors. With his quick wit and silver
tongue, he hopes to sway some wealthy noble or an adventurer flush
with looted gold to finance his operation. At the face of it, it may
seem a grand investment. The play is really good. The problem is that
though Dominik may put on a great play, he will remain a terrible
businessman. Paying off the crime lord and his mismanagement ensures
any financial venture is doomed to failure.

Runebearer
The message is my life.
(Core) The Undgrin Ankor, a network of elaborate tunnels that once ran the length of the World’s Edge
Mountains, connects the Dwarfholds east of the Empire. Communication between holds is carried out
by means of Runebearers – specially trained young Dwarfs who risk life and limb to carry messages
(written in the runic script of the Dwarfs) from one hold to another. Over recent centuries, as
more Dwarfholds have fallen to the Goblinoids and more tunnels have become ruined, the
Runebearers’ lot has become increasingly difficult. They are forced to take more circuitous
routes, and even these are fraught with danger as the enemies discover the routes. Often,
Runebearers must leave the tunnels altogether and cross mountains and valleys on the
surface. Runebearers who specialize in long distances are sometimes used to carry messages
between the Dwarf communities of the Empire and those of mountains.
Note: Only Dwarfs can enter this career.

Little Known Facts
While much is made of the mission of the lone runebearer running
franticly to carry his message, many dwarf leaders do not place all their
faith in a single messenger. Often, multiple runebearers are dispatched,
along different routes, so that there is a much greater chance of at
least one delivering his message. This is almost never discussed with
outsiders, as the dwarves prefer their enemies to believe that if they have
stopped one messenger, they have stopped them all.
There is great competition among runebearers to move quickly.
Often, it can be very risky to move too fast, lest you stumble into an
ambush or attract too much attention. Dwarven legends extol the
fastest runebearers, and beardlings all dream of someday being among
them. The greatest distance recorded by a single runebearer is from the
mountains near Kislev to those of Estalia; every runebearer’s dream is to
set a new record in the Kislev Run.
To fail to deliver a message in time – and to still live – is a runebearer’s
greatest shame. Those who have arrived too late may take up the mantle
of a slayer to exonerate themselves.
A Day in the Life
During relatively peaceful times runebearers work in their local
communities, carrying messages through mining tunnels and across
well-known roads. Their work is generally light, and the risks they must
take at other times means they are afforded some relaxation. Inevitably,
though, the call will come.
The runebearer must race to receive his message and his instructions.
Sometimes, he does not know what the message actually is – it is coded
and he doesn’t know the how to interpret it, so he cannot reveal it under
torture if captured. All he needs to know is where it must go and who
must receive it.
On a “run,” the runebearer cannot waste time. Food and sleep are taken
only sparingly. Young runebearers are trained to know the signs of
starvation and exhaustion and taught that there is no glory, or purpose,
in travelling three-fourths of the way there and then dying of thirst, the
message undelivered. All other distractions, though, are set aside.
A runebearer knows not just his chosen route, but a dozen alternate
paths, and will veer off at the first sign of trouble. Glory, for him,
does not come in combat, but in performance – stopping to battle
goblinoids, even if victory seems certain, is just a delay he cannot afford.
Adventure Seeds
Missing Messages: During some confusion near a large city, a
runebearer’s pack – and the message he swore to deliver – stolen by a
thief, who has since vanished into the city’s underworld. The message
is of no financial value, but who knows what enemies of the dwarves
might make of it? The thief might even discard it without realizing what
he carries. The runebearer must enter the city and somehow track down
the message.
One Final Request: In the aftermath of a battle with goblins, an
injured runebearer is found. He is barely alive, and has time only to
cough out the location of the recipient of his message before he dies. No
Dwarf, hearing this, would refuse to take the message where it belongs –
no matter how far he has to go.

Runelord
A Day In The Life
A runelord may take one of two paths in his life. The majority, choose
to live among their fellow dwarfs, where they are figures of legendary
power. While they do continue to hone and practise their craft, for the
most part, it is the refinement of an already refined art.
They serve as advisors, arbiters and symbols of all that it means to be
a dwarf, and their day is filled with meetings, tours of the community,
checking and overseeing the works of the runemasters, and so on. Only
during rare interludes can they actually turn to their tools and forges and
craft new items – and given the Rule of Pride, it is very rare they come
up with an item they have never made before over their long career.
A fair number, perhaps a quarter or so, do not take this path. They
retreat from the community into deep study, sequestering themselves
inside workshop-libraries located in the deepest heart of the most
secure dwarf holds. They will ring themselves with masters, journeymen
and apprentices, who will eagerly labour for months just to hear a
single word of praise or helpful advice from their reclusive lord. Such
runelords will emerge from their self-imposed exile once a year, or
sometimes less, to fulfil with great reluctance their ceremonial or
symbolic duties, and then return.
Rarest of all are the adventuring runelords. It takes a lot to get such a
skilled individual to travel dark and dangerous paths; their motivations
are unique and often inscrutable. Any band of travellers who has such
a companion is blessed, and there is no telling how long they will
continue to spend time away from their families and studies.
Little Known Facts
Runelords are strongly encouraged to take a wife and produce heirs.
Even the most reclusive and curmudgeonly will honour this duty if at
all possible; to fail is too great a shame to bear or mention.
It is rumoured that the oldest and greatest runelords do not die; rather,
after too long without hearing from them, the most senior masters in a
community will enter the lord’s work area, to find nothing there but his
final work, and carry on his legacy from that moment onward.
Adventure Seeds
The Lord’s Return: A runelord vanished in a fierce orcish raid a
decade ago, and a master runesmith was raised up in his place. Now,
however, the presumed dead runelord has returned, demanding his
old post. In the meantime, his former apprentice has risen through the
ranks and attained the stature of runelord himself. Attempts to get them
to share authority have failed, and the returning runelord refuses to
accept the newly raised runelord’s status. The families of the two Dwarfs
are at odds, and things could get ugly.
Visitation: A runelord is coming to a major human city in order
to meet with a wizard lord with whom he has had a long and useful
correspondence – despite their very, very different backgrounds and
views on the arcane. The arrival of such an august entity is causing all
kinds of disruption. Just about everyone is trying to find some way to
exploit this, especially cells of Chaos cultists who know they can greatly
damage dwarf/human relations should the visitor die while under
Imperial protection.
Runelord
You show potential. Get back to me in a century.
(RoS) The Runelords are the greatest of the Runesmiths. A Runelord candidate
may only be promoted with the death of an existing Runelord, so this position
is highly coveted and contested. Among the Dwarfs, Runelords are equal to
kings, and so they move through Dwarf society as some of its most esteemed
members. A few Runelords withdraw from the world, sequestering themselves
away to learn the deeper secrets of the Master Runes and perhaps create a few of
their own, further diminishing their numbers as their names become legend.

The Travelling School
While many scholars focus on a single field of study, many scholars
enjoy researching a broad range of topics. However, scholarly pursuits
take up a great deal of time, and travel throughout the Empire to visit
various libraries can be expensive.
To encourage studies and obviate the need for travel, a group of former
students from Altdorf have developed a secretive book club, which they
have dubbed the Travelling School. After their years together in Altdorf,
the scholars went their separate ways, but still kept in close contact with
each other.
The Travelling School refers not to the scholars making rounds to visit
with each other, but instead to the numerous books they send to each
other. After one scholar has located a rare book and finished studying
it, he passes it along to one of his colleagues, who does likewise with a
tome of his own.
The scholars employ all manner of caraveners, messengers, pilgrims,
coach lines and the like to deliver their books for the Travelling School.
However, many of these rare books are incredibly expensive, and some
contain material that would be considered... improper... for research by
an upright citizen of the Empire. As such, discretion is paramount when
deliverng the books to members of the Travelling School.
A Day in the Life
Scholars spend the bulk of their time each day researching; if they are
being paid to do so, their research will delve only into those matters
concerning their employer’s request for information. If left to their
own devices, most scholars would meticulously follow every lead,
every thread of information within their areas of interest to its logical
conclusion, cataloging any newly discovered leads for later exploration
and study.
Devoting the bulk of their lives to the accumulation of knowledge,
scholars are the learned people that the authorities must turn to on
occasion. As such they are sometimes employed by a lord or religious
leader and well-paid, but more often than not work freelance and live a
hand-to-mouth existence.
Some specialise in religious or philosophical topics, while others are
experts on the subject of law, mathematics, linguistics, science, and
even dark, forbidden lore – though short is the tenure of the scholar
discovered to be dabbling in lore best left unlearnt.
Adventure Seeds
Scholarly Pursuits: A scholar has discovered an old text hinting at the
existence of the burial mound of an Unberogen chieftain from before
the time of Sigmar. The scholar is excited that excavation of the tomb
will improve current understanding of the burial rituals of the predynastic
Unberogen kings. The mound lies within an unexplored tract
of the Reikwald Forest, and the scholar requires a party of bodyguards
to help him reach it, and to help dig up its secrets.
A Forbidden Tome: A messenger is found dead in the streets,
clutching a leather satchel. Inside the satchel is a grim book bound in
cured flesh and a scrap of paper with an address to a wizened old scholar
who lives on the estates of a minor noble. Was this book possibly passed
along via the mysterious Travelling School? And if so, for what purpose?

Scourge of God
Oh, ye of little faith! Witness the grace of our god! It is writ in blood upon my body, His
most holy commandment. Every drop I bleed is further proof of His favour!
(ToS) Those who serve their Gods as flagellants sometimes survive
throwing themselves into danger to smite the forces of Chaos and
darkness. Those who survive long enough become scourges of God,
mighty warriors for their deity, blessed with a degree of divine
protection.
Scourges of God are often highly charismatic, and gather other fanatics
around them. In times of war, they are highly praised by the cult hierarchy,
but when peace comes the priests prefer to move them along as quickly as
possible, lest they find too many “enemies of God” within the towns of cities.
Most scourges of God die bravely in battle, but some do move on, often to other ways of
discovering and punishing the corrupt. Scourges of God almost always substitute the name
of their God when describing themselves: scourge of Sigmar, scourge of Ulric, and so on.

A Scourge of God exhibits his devotion in a different manner,
depending on the god he worships:
Manann: A Scourge of Manann lashes himself to a ship’s mast and
undergoes voluntary keelhauling while shouting praises to the Lord
of the Seas. The scourge’s booming voice rivals the fiercest storms and
instills fear in his enemies.
Morr: The cold, penetrating glare from a Scourge of Morr seems to
peer into a man’s soul. To prove their favour with Morr, these fanatics
are buried alive for days at a time, after which they report visions from
the Land of Death.
Myrmidia: Myrmidia’s Scourges ride atop palanquins carried by their
zealous followers. They go bare-chested into battle and slash their own
bodies with knives while reciting verses from the Bellona Myrmidia.
Ranald: No one has ever reported seeing a Scourge of Ranald, for the
Trickster’s ways are secretive. However, several peasant rebellions have
been led by raving madmen who might have been devotees of the
Protector.
Shallya: Scourges of Shallya take the burdens of the world upon
themselves by attaching heavy weights to their limbs and wandering
among the diseased and dying.
Sigmar: Sigmarite Scourges punish themselves with spiked flails. Their
zealots carry braziers so Scourges can brand themselves whilst reciting
verses from the Deus Sigmar. The Scourges often goes shirtless to expose
his heavily scarred body.
Taal and Rhya: Scourges of Taal and Rhya take month-long journeys
into the dangerous forest, alone. They carry no weapons on these
journeys and some even go stark naked. When they finally emerge in a
feral state, no one questions their divine favour.
Ulric: Like their Sigmarite counterparts, scourges of Ulric flog
themselves with spiked flails whilst foaming at the mouth and shouting
passages from the Liber Lupus. They expose themselves to extreme cold
to demonstrate Ulric’s blessing.
Verena: Scourges of Verena attend criminal trials where they undergo
ordeals of fire or water before the accused to demonstrate the justness of
their god. If the accused survives the ordeal himself, he is urged to join
the Scourge’s retinue.
Protection of the Gods
A Scourge of God possesses an uncanny ability to survive impossible
predicaments. The GM should be lenient when assigning Criticals
resulting from self-inflicted injuries, reducing their value to the nearest
non-fatal result. Many scourges are blind, deaf or immobile as a result
of their injuries. Missing limbs are common. Despite this, crippled
scourges continue to subject themselves to extreme punishment even if
it requires their followers to carry or assist them.
When a Scourge of God uses a Fate Point, the GM can narrate the
effect as miraculous divine intervention. Witnesses of the miracle who
follow the same god can be recruited more easily into the scourge’s
retinue following such an event, and those who do not follow the
scourge’s god are more easily converted afterwards.
Adventure Seeds
Proving Faith: The scourge’s cult is losing followers in the local area,
and it needs someone to restore the people’s faith. There are some who
doubt the scourge’s claims to divine favour and demand proof.

(Core) Scouts are rare individuals who are more at home in the wild than in the teeming

usually roam ahead of their clients, seeking out ambushes and other troubles that may beset a

Scouts Outside the Empire
While scouts are commonly found in the wildernesses among the
Empire’s borders, they also serve beyond them. While outriders are
expected to blaze trails and reconnoiter for organized caravans and large
parties, scouts help smaller (or more covert) groups and individuals find
their way around the edges of the Empire.
Equally at home in forest or mountains, a scout can identify trouble,
help hunt up meals, and keep watch. A scout is an invaluable ally,
whether the task is to discover where orcs amass in the World’s Edge
Mountains, map out the passes above the Ostermark, or lead traitorous
discussions with the goblins or orcs of the Grey Mountains.
While it may take some time to grow accustomed to the nuances of
a foreign land, truly gifted scouts will slowly acclimate to any region.
Their ability to adapt is vital to their trade, and their survival.
Andrus Taurbach
Andrus felt the calling of the woods and the Horned God early in his
life in Talabecland. By the age of 13, he found the god’s grove near his
village and became an initiate. On his annual retreat in the wooded
Farlic Hills, Andrus embraced true wildness.
Visions from Taal’s aspect as Karnos, Lord of Beasts, left Andrus
madly animalistic for months. Holy men restored Andrus to sanity
by taking him into their order and marking him with the facial and
chest tattoos of the Horned Hunters. Andrus remained within the
forests of Talabecland, making them safe for all of Taal’s creations while
embracing the Horned Hunter’s ways.
Andrus has seen the rise of evil among the trees, having slain many
beastmen who hide in the forests since the death of the Beastlord
Graktar. Rather than recluse himself among the woods, Andrus has
become a notable scout in Talabecland.
His rescue of the famed demagogue Ionor Suarlat and her fellow elves
from skaven resulted in him being awarded a prized elfbow five years
ago and he has been an honored elf-friend ever since.
Other Horned Hunters whisper that Taal goads Andrus toward a
destiny as a ghost strider. Andrus, as always, keeps his silence and simply
listens to the winds, watches the trees, and ensures his weapons and
senses remain sharp.
Adventure Seeds
Retracing His Steps: A scout staggers into town, suffering horrible
wounds (ragged and infected axe blows). The elf gasps the words “Black
Surrik walks in anger…” and dies before he regains consciousness. The
party must retrace the scout’s trail (with or without another scout’s help)
and uncover exactly what threat this poses for the province.
Official Duty: Scouting and trailblazing within (or outside) the
Empire is a campaign with much potential for adventure. As many
patrol the roads and the waterways, the party can hunt out the perils
within the uncharted wilderness between the cities and villages.

(Core) Since most citizens of the Empire are illiterate, Scribes are very much in demand. Virtually every
government, civil, military, or religious institution requires a large number of Scribes for record keeping.
There are also public Scribes, who make a living writing and reading letters for the common folk. Scribes
are well educated and many go on to become Scholars or lawyers. A few tire of reading about the
adventures of others and resolve to have some of their own. With their extensive knowledge of other
languages, they make excellent translators for foreign expeditions.

Anton Hollenberg and His Amazing Pantograph
Anton is not only a masterful scribe, but also the inventor of a
fabulous device – the pantograph. The pantograph is a mechanical
wonder a scribe wears like a glove. The glove is linked by delicate and
cleverly jointed arms to another pen that duplicates the writer’s every
move. Thus Anton has invented a very crude sort of copying device.
Whenever Anton performs his duties as a scribe, he always uses the
pantograph. This ensures he has not only the copy he submits to the
client, but also a copy for his own records. That is why his life is now in
grave danger.
One of Anton’s clients was a wealthy merchant. He had Anton carefully
and studiously copy letters and stationary from the merchant’s rough
and barely legible hand into Anton’s beautiful calligraphy. Anton then
returned both the original and the copy to the client. But he kept
the pantograph’s copy for himself. It turned out that the merchant
in question was actually a powerful magus of a chaos cult. Encoded
within those letters were instructions to his minions. Now the witch
hunters have started to ferret the merchant out. He has burned all of
his incriminating letters. It was only by a stroke of luck that he learned
about Anton’s pantograph.
Desperate, he needs all those letters and Herr Hollenberg destroyed to
completely cover his tracks. Using his underground contacts, assassins
have been hired. Soon, a hapless scribe will be stalked by professional
killers.
The Faithful Brotherhood of Scribes and
Scriveners
At first glance, this appears to be a normal and rather pedestrian guild.
In reality, this scribe’s guild is not to be trifled with. Years of copying
and sorting through the records of every major institution means
the scribes have dirt on everyone. The Brotherhood’s records vault, a
legendary depository of blackmail material, is sealed , hidden, and kept
under great security. The Faithful Brotherhood rewards its members for
turning in dated, verifiable, and incriminating documents on prominent
citizens. They are patient, preferring to slowly accumulate information
until their evidence is indeed damning. What do the scribes do with this
information? Nothing, so long as their members are well treated, well
paid, and fairly dealt with. Crossing a guild scribe is a truly dangerous
undertaking.
Adventure Seeds
Outsiders Needed: A scribe employed by a township has discovered
that the lord-mayor is embezzling large amounts of money from the city
coffers. He would reveal what he knows, but he is afraid the thoroughly
corrupt mayor will discover him and seek violent retribution. He needs
protection and an escort to the county seat if this fraud is to be revealed.
He needs someone from out-of-town that is not in the mayor’s pocket.
He turns to the party.
Secrets Revealed: A scribe believes he has managed to finally decrypt
an ancient treasure map. He tries to gather a group of like-minded
adventurers to follow it and see where it leads.

Sea Captain
Avast ye lubbers! Stow anchor and prepare to set sail!
(Core) Sea Captains roam the oceans of the Old World seeking profit and adventure over the next
horizon. Strictly honourable Sea Captains are far-travelling traders who only sail in search of the most
profitable markets for their goods. The most dangerous are bloodthirsty pirates, attacking other ships
for plunder and leaving no survivors. Most Sea Captains fall somewhere in between. On a sea-going
vessel a Captain’s word is law. Sailors, however, are a fractious lot; a Sea Captain must be clever,
strong-willed and a bit ruthless to stay in command. The most famous Sea Captains come from
Marienburg, Tilea, and the Elven island of Ulthuan.

A Day In The Life
Pirate or privateer? Explorer or exploiter? With each dawning day, a
sea captain can choose his path. The seas of the Old World are lawless
places, and a man (or sometimes, woman) is free to carve their own
destiny – possibly on the bodies of their foes.
The most important thing, though, is running the ship. A ship, pirate
or merchant does not run itself. A captain must know every detail of the
ship, and be able to do any job any of his crew can do – and do it better.
He must also quickly judge who can step in to replace a fallen crewman
– and who can’t. He is judge of more than that: he must keep order on
his ship, establishing and enforcing the rules, often brutally with lash or
blade as needed. Yet, no matter how firm he is, he must also be fair; his
crew will endure his rules so long as he delivers on his promises and is
not random or arbitrary.
Life at sea is regimented. Watches are kept and logs must be updated.
Sloppiness can lead to failure, a rope left to fray can snap in battle, a
logbook which is incomplete can lead to the ship foundering, lost and
alone. The captain’s day is spent barking orders, but also constantly
evaluating the situation and solving problems before they arise. The
promise of profit or plunder can keep a crew in line, but the captain
must eventually deliver, and it must be clear to the crew that his vision,
knowledge and discipline is what got them to that point.
New Rules
Thriving In Confusion: A ship normally must run like a clock, but
during times of crisis, such as a sudden storm or a boarding party, the
clock breaks. A sea captain in such a situation must master a dozen
things at once, constantly aware of an ever-changing situation. To reflect
this, someone who has taken five advances in this career may use any of
the Sea Captain Skills which normally require a full or half action as a
free action by spending a Fortune Point, as he gives orders or performs
tasks almost by instinct.
This ability comes into play at the GM’s discretion, and only during
times of great stress, when there are many things happening at the same
time. Note that in a combat situation, only the basic action, Use a Skill,
is affected by this rule (see WFRP page 127).
Adventure Seeds
Rescued At Sea: Something bad has happened to the characters’
transport, and they are clinging to a raft which drifts into the path
of a heavily armed merchant vessel flying a Tilean flag. The captain,
following ancient codes of the sea, decides to bring them on board, but
they must work for their passage, and he will make sure that they learn
their skills. (This is a good chance for characters to switch to a maritime
career). It soon becomes apparent that the “merchant ship” is a welldisguised
pirate craft. Will the characters eagerly join in the plunder, or
will they try to turn the ship and its captain in for a large reward?
Far From Home: A little drink on the town... and a renowned sea
captain finds himself kidnapped, bound and finally awakened in a slave
caravan in Araby, five hundred miles from the sea! It is there that he
manages to meet the characters. He promises them a vast reward if they
can get him back to his ship, docked in a Tilean port... but he is a man
used to being obeyed, even when his “ship” is a camel. Can this fish out
of water manage to survive without being killed by either the desert, the
bandits who took him or the people trying to rescue him? And why was
he kidnapped in the first place?

Seaman
There ain’t enough rum to get me back on that ship. But rum and a bit of gold might do.
(Core) Most Imperial seamen come from the province of Nordland, which has a long stretch of coast
on the Sea of Claws. The Greatships, Wolfships, and Wargalleys of the Imperial Fleet patrol these
waters, protecting the Empire from Norse longships, Bretonnian buccaneers, and the dreaded fleets
of Chaos. Hardened Seaman crew these ships, while their compatriots sail merchantmen, pirate vessels,
and other privately owned craft. Elven sailors can be found on the Sea of Claws as well, particularly
those engaged by their great Merchant Houses. The activity of the region revolves around
Marienburg, the greatest port in the Old World. This city and its surrounding area (known as
the Wasteland) used to be the Imperial province of Westerland but it bought its independence
years ago. While Marienburg itself is neutral territory, the Sea of Claws is the site of daily clashes.
On blood-soaked decks, Seamen earn their rum ration and their booty.
Note: During character creation, if you take Common Knowledge (the Wasteland), your character can
be from the great port of Marienburg at your option.

Roles on a Ship
Able Seaman: This is the basic seaman career, and the backbone of any
ship. The seaman needs to know both the rigging and the sails, as well as
the basics of steering and navigation. The seaman must be able to read
the skies, weather, winds and, most importantly, the mood of his captain.
Carpenter (Tradesman): The carpenter is aboard a ship to repair battle
and weather damage to masts, yards, hatches and the hull, and keep a
watchful eye on the ship’s leaky seams with wooden plugs and oakum.
Gunner: The gunner is responsible for the operation and care of the
ship’s guns and ammunition. Some of the gunner’s daily duties include
the sifting of black-powder to keep it dry and the inspection of cannon
and cannon balls for signs of rust. In combat, the gunner is not just an
expert at aiming, but is acquainted with all stages in the firing process:
loading, aiming, firing, resetting and swabbing for the next load.
Sailmaker (Tradesman): The sailmaker is in charge of maintaining all of
the fabrics and canvases on the ship: sails, flags, hammocks, and so on.
Prize Money
In the Old World, seized enemy ships and cargo become the property
of the capturing nation or merchant. This was a convenient system for
organisations like the Imperial navy, who could reward their fleets with
monies gained from the value of the seized ship rather than their own
coffers. In time, seamen came to see enemy ships as “prizes”. Therefore,
money gained from the sale of prizes became known as prize money.
Merchant ships that fly the flag of an enemy realm are also fair game for
capture, and are especially sought after. The prize money from these ships
comes from the sale of both the ship and cargo, which could be a very
lucrative transaction for the lucky seaman.
If the captured vessel is an enemy warship, and repairable, the navy will
pay prize money equaling the fair market value for a craft of similar size.
The only exception to this rule is for orc warships and watercraft—no
civilised realm will pay for those. The navy also pays an additional prize
bonus per enemy aboard the captured ship. The navy will also pay a
“head money” bonus for captured enemy sailors.
The lure of prize money has called many hopefuls to a hard life at sea.
A lucky seaman could find himself making a year’s pay or more in the
course of one battle. The following scheme for distribution of prize
money is standard among the merchant fleets and navies of the Old
World. Allocation is by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money goes to
the captain, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial
circles. One eighth of the money goes to the admiral who signed the
ship’s written orders. One eighth is divided among the first mate,
quartermaster, and bosun. Two eighths are divided among the master
of sails, master carpenter, master gunner and their mates. The final
two eighths are divided among the crew, with seamen, sailmakers and
marines receiving larger shares than cabin boys.

Seer

(ToC) Seers are self-appointed authorities on all matters involving the spiritual world. They can
be found in marketplaces of any town, proclaiming their latest revelation to anyone who will
listen. Since Seers operate outside the bounds of sanctioned religious laws, and purport to
understand the will of the Gods, they are easy targets for persecutions by Witch Hunters,
who don’t draw a line of distinction between the authentic seers and the charlatans. In
Norsca, however, Seers are valued members of a Jarl’s entourage, reading the signs and
portents in the entrails of their sacrifice or translating the flickers of fire to divine some
glimpse of future events.

A Day in the Life
A seer is a useful source of information, ranging from arcane matters to
mundane occurrences. As such, they are in constant demand by people
of all walks of life.
Seers often accompany the retinue of a jarl. If a jarl has had a weird
dream, witnessed a star falling from the heavens, or experienced any
other portent, he will approach his seer for an interpretation of the
omen. No seer is foolish enough to give an answer that might displease
their master, so the truth is always caged in platitudes.
Those seers who live among the community face a tide of petitioners
throughout the day. To weed out those who might come with trivial
questions, seers often dwell in remote locations; only the most persistent
will bother making the journey. The gifts that visitors bring sustain the
seer in food, drink and clothes.
A few seers see themselves as prophets, speaking for the gods, and travel
from settlement to settlement preaching about the omens that they have
seen. However, when their words warn of doom and woe, they quickly
outstay their welcome and are often driven into the wilderness by an
angry mob.
Some seers take up a wandering lifestyle, travelling between farms and
villages to offer their esoteric services in return for food and shelter; for
example, they might divine the future of a farmer’s crop or the success
of a trader’s impending voyage. They also present themselves at the
birth of a child and search it for marks that betray the gods’ favour… or
displeasure.
Notable Figures
Yngve Aarseth is a deranged and powerful seer. He is greatly respected
– and feared – throughout Norsca. His eyes were torn out long ago
when he was held captive by a malicious band of goblin raiders, Aarseth
claims that his physical blindness allows him to “see all truth.”
The wizened old seer refuses to serve any of the jarls, even when they
threaten him with torture or imprisonment. He knows that the jarls are
too frightened of his powers to carry out their threats.
Aarseth can be found roaming the streets of Olricstaad, answering
any question that is asked of him – by anyone – in his hoarse, gentle
whisper. This changes, however, in the dark of night … especially
during a full moon. During such times, the seer goes to the town
square of Olricstaad, and sacrifices a young goat with his strangely
curved silver knife. In the pools of blood that spatter the cobblestones,
Aarseth draws out pictures of men, all of whom he claims shall die
within the coming year. While this claim seems preposterous, no one
has been able to dispute his prophecies.
Adventure Seeds
An Ill Omen: A star falls in the night-time sky over a village… and in
the morning, a nearby farm has completely burned to ashes. The local
jarl sends two of his guards to investigate, but only one returns and he
has been driven insane. A local seer loudly predicted such a thing might
happen an entire week leading up to the tragedy, now the jarl would
seek his counsel to see what other ill omens menace the land. But the
seer is suddenly nowhere to be found.

Hated and Loved
“Sergeant Haug had a voice like granite soaked in rum: ‘Hold to, men,
hold to. That’s it, lads. Don’t fire ’til you see the reds of their eyes. Steady
now! You’ve faced worse than this, you miserable wretches. Baumer…do
I perceive your mother among those green-skinned baboons coming at
us? Krebs, steady your gun, lad, you’re not hunting geese. Hold it, hold
it…FIRE!’
He bellowed the tenderfoots into shape, and his barbed wit killed the
cockiness of us veterans. How we hated him, yet how we loved him. He
was the backbone of the unit, bullying us into shape. The renown we
won was all thanks to him: our duty to the Emperor never shirked, and
we gave as good as we got from the muzzles of our guns. We’d rather
take our chances face on against the enemy than endure the full-blown
anger of our Old Man.”
–Trooper Fuchs of the Altdorf 3rd Handgunner Regiment
A Superstitious Breed
Sergeants believe that they enjoy a blessed existence. Veterans of a score
of battles, they have a knack of emerging unscathed – except for the
scars that they proudly exhibit. They consider their longevity a blessing
from the gods, and go to peculiar lengths to preserve this favoured
status.
As he walks, a typical sergeant rattles from the dozens of charms and
relics that adorn his uniform, such as relic bones, luck stones, or blessed
coins. His magnificently curled moustache, waxed from ear to ear, is not
simply an overstated nod to fashion – it is considered highly unlucky to
trim his upper lip while on campaign.
A superstitious sergeant has a ward or talisman for every ominous
occasion. For example, on the eve of a battle taking place during
inauspicious occasions such as the Day of Folly, a solar eclipse, or the
waxing of Morrsleib, a sergeant may avoid touching anything made of
oak (oak being the traditional material for the construction of coffins),
refuse to perform any action widdershins (it said that spirits are led
to Morr’s kingdom in a counterclockwise direction), or may spend a
sleepless night whispering prayers and supplication to each of the gods
in the pantheon.
After all, it’s always best to prepare for every contingency.
Adventure Seeds
The Draft: War looms over the province, and the adventurers find
themselves drafted into the local army. Their sergeant is a vicious man,

the edge of revolt. There are whispers of a plot to do away with him in
the heat of battle. Will the adventurers swallow their hatred and attempt
to quell the mutiny, or will they relish the sergeant’s murder?
A Sergeant’s Duty: A sergeant’s commanding officer has been captured
during a battle against marauding orcs. The sergeant feels it is his
duty to follow the retreating orcs to their mountain lair and rescue his
beloved leader, despite the fact that he will face almost certain death.

be they Nobles, Guild Masters, or Innkeepers. It is possible for a Servant to work up to
a better position, but the path is difficult. No one wants to listen to the lad that was cleaning

A Day in the Life
The life of a servant is much like that of a burgher, but far lower down
on the social ladder. The servant rises earlier and rests later. They usually
live where they work, in the crudest of accommodations – a palette of
straw in the barn, or a pile of rags in the basement. Breakfast is a simple
porridge, sometimes stretched with sawdust. Then comes the workday.
Unlike apprentices and crafters, a servant is considered to have no
valuable skills or unique abilities. They can be replaced at whim, and
they are reminded of this constantly. There is also no real hope of
advancement, at least not without a radical shift in career.
Some few manage, however – there are tales of the serving maid who
gained control of the inn where she worked, or the stable hand who
somehow managed to become a burgher. For most, though, the best
hope is to be given a position of menial authority, where they can
cruelly bully and harass other servants.
Verbal and physical abuse is common. It is not surprising, then, that the
short, brutal life of an adventurer appeals. For many, it is the only path
out of a lifetime of drudgery.
Special Rule
Walk Unseen: Servants are usually beneath notice. It is possible for a
maid to clean a room where a dozen nobles are gathered to plot treason,
without them ever really noticing her. A servant may act as if they had
the skill Concealment (or gain a +10% bonus to it, if they already have
it), but only when they are in their “proper place” and are otherwise
expected to be there. This ability persists even after they’ve left the
career, provided they can still manage to look the part.
Adventure Seeds
I Quit!: While servants leave their jobs all the time, lately, there has
been a near-epidemic of people walking out. It has gotten to the point
where the burghers and merchants have begun to take notice, even
raising wages in some cases! Many blame spies and agitators, but there
has been no indication that the ranks of political activists have been
swelling. Indeed, the servants who quit seem to simply vanish into the
city without a trace. What is causing this, and where are they going?
A Harmless Scam: The newest hire at the local tavern is utterly and
obviously ill-suited for her job. If she is questioned about this, in very
little time, she will break down and spin a tale of escaping a forced
marriage arranged by her noble family. She pleads that she be left alone.
She is, however, lying, and is exactly what she appears to be – a low
born woman of few prospects – who has decided to play the part of
a fleeing noble. She hopes to be “rescued” by someone whom she can
then take for everything they’ve got, before moving on to the next town
and repeating the scam.
Now Recruiting: An aging merchant is looking for a new servant
to look after him. He is willing to pay a much larger wage than the
job would normally demand, and dozens of people are vying for the
position. However, rumour reaches the characters that the position was
filled (and already vacated) twice within the last few weeks. Is the old
man that difficult to work for? Or is there something more nefarious
going on in the merchant’s household?

(AoM) The Sewer Jacks are a specialised force, under the command of the City Watch, whose purpose is to keep the sewer
system and the Undercity (see AoM p. 28) secure. A certain amount of courage is required to police the

The Life of a Sewer Jack
In medium-sized towns, sewer jacks work in teams of two or three,
clearing blockages and burning off pockets of explosive gas. Cities
employ larger teams of up to eight jacks, because their sprawling sewers
are often inhabited by giant rats and other creatures. Small towns and
villages do not have sewers; waste is simply discarded in streets, rivers,
or cisterns.
Sewer maintenance is neither healthy nor glamourous. Prolonged
exposure to the bad air and filth causes stomach and lung ailments.
If a section of sewer ductwork is damaged, stonemasons may be
commissioned to repair it, but the dirty, everyday maintenance work is
handled by sewer jacks. The stench relentlessly clings to flesh and hair,
even after bathing.
In cities with tunnels and catacombs intersecting the sewer system,
sewer jacks are responsible for driving out squatters, criminals, and
even skaven. These exploits comprise most of the sewer jacks’ barroom
tales, but few Old Worlders are willing to believe them. Surely the
ruins of an elven city couldn’t possibly exist right below their feet.
Rats that walk and talk like men? Children’s fantasies. The public’s
fear, skepticism, and denial often prevent sewer jacks from gaining the
recognition they deserve.
The Fauschlag Delvers
Beneath the city of Middenheim is a tunnel network so expansive that
whole sections remain unexplored to this day. Following the Storm of
Chaos, the city’s rulers decided that a troublesome skaven stronghold
within the mountain must finally be exterminated. To this end, the
local sewer jacks were absorbed into the Middenheim army as a special
regiment, called the Fauschlag Delvers. Dwarven sappers and tunnel
fighters were attached to every unit and even battle mages from Altdorf
were recruited. The Fauschlag Delvers received training and equipment
superior to any sewer jack company in the Old World.
The Delvers escalated their campaign when scouts reported vague
sightings of a massive technological device within the skaven
stronghold. At their peak, the Delvers conducted dozens of raids
each day. But major operations ended following a massive explosion
that rocked the under-city, killing over half of the Delvers along with
hundreds of their skaven foes. Sections of the city still remain unstable
from the blast. Does the skaven Clan Skryre retain sufficient power to
unleash its mysterious “Project Supremacy” in Middenheim, or was the
Doom Hemisphere irreparably damaged?
The Fauschlag Delvers’ sacrifice has boosted public esteem for the sewer
jack profession in Middenland. Mercenaries from across the province
now travel to Middenheim for enlistment.
Adventure Seeds
The Stink of Corruption: Corruption is rife among the local sewer
jacks. Bribes from the thieves’ guild are considered routine business,
while moral rectitude is rewarded with a knife in the back. A petty
smuggler buys the sewer jack’s silence, but soon it becomes evident that
he’s part of a much larger operation.
Flotsam and Jetsam: A recent flash flood has clogged the sewers with
drifting river flotsam, and now all the garderobes of Osterplatzen are
backed up. Someone must find the blockage and remove it. But the
river has also brought something else into the sewers, and it’s starting to
eat people…

A Day in the Life
The life of a shieldbreaker is one of honour and blood, sacrifice, and
duty to their clan. Each day when they rise, they recite the oaths of
loyalty, a litany of the names of their ancestors and the glory of their
clan, ending with a pledge to spill the blood of the clan’s enemies. They
will then spend several hours servicing their armour and weapons, as
is the dwarf way, sharpening blades to razor-fine edges and polishing
armour to a dull shine.
The rest of the day is typically spent patrolling and training with their
weapons. If they are garrisoned near the clan’s hold they will spend
hours marching the tunnels, hunting any goblins, orcs or skaven foolish
enough to venture up from the depths. Periodically they will rest and
spend an hour or so drilling, the clash of arms echoing up and down the
tunnels. Finally they will return to their camp and finish the day doing
what dwarfs do best – drinking!
The Shieldbreaker’s Oath
A shieldbreaker’s first and last duty is to their clan. Whether they
have taken up the title for honour or gold (something equally
interchangeable for Dwarfs) they are expected to put no power, lord, or
god before their oath to the clan. Even when a shieldbreaker is far from
his clan’s holdings he is expected to always conduct himself with honour
and courage, mindful that he represents not only himself, but the clan
wherever he travels.
A close second to a Shieldbreaker’s duty to the clan is his duty to the
dwarf race. He is expected to constantly fight against the foes of the
dwarf wherever they are found. As dwarfs are slow to forgive and have
long memories, their enemies can be found almost anywhere.
While most shieldbreakers are dwarfs, there are rare instances when a
member of another race will take up arms and oaths for the dwarfs.
Humans have been known to become shieldbreakers, usually those who
live close to dwarf holds or have befriended a dwarf.
Sometimes when a human fights side by side with dwarfs and impresses
the doughty warriors with his prowess, he will be invited to serve the
clan. However, such a life is far from easy for a non-dwarf, and they
must constantly struggle to prove themselves with feats of daring and
courage in combat and strength and endurance otherwise.
In fact the first test of a non-dwarf shieldbreaker is usually to be taken
deep underground, without light or food, and forced to find their way
back to the surface. It is an easy task for most dwarfs, but can be fatal
for softer races.
Adventure Seeds
The Breaking of Oaths: A mercenary shieldbreaker from the
Blackcragg Clan has broken his oaths and pillaged gold from the clan
holds. The oath-breaker, a man by the name of Siegrek, has fled into the
Empire. The clan is calling for all dwarfs of honour and their allies to
see this crime avenged and Siegrek brought to justice.
Last Request: An old dwarf lies dying in a remote Empire village. No
one knows where he came from, but he has lived in the village for many
years. Now as he is close to passing he is calling for a shieldbreaker to
pass on an ancient secret – the location of a long lost dwarf hold!

Skald
They will sing of our victory today for generations. I’ll see to it myself.
(ToC) Skalds are the keepers of lore, the chroniclers of the histories of the Norse. Part entertainer,
part warrior, these individuals are held in high esteem for their wisdom and knowledge. All Kings
keep Skalds in their retinues, as do most Jarls. When the call for war is sounded, the Skald bears the
banner and marches to battle with his comrades.

A Day in the Life
The skald rises at an early hour, as soon as the breakfast fires in the
Jarl’s great hall are kindled. After all, he would be grieved to miss any
pertinent gossip (and heartbroken to miss impertinent gossip). Also, the
skald may have enemies (at least, he will if he’s any good) and in Norsca
it is wise to wake before those who hate you.
A skald is a learned man, contemplating the written sagas of the Norse
and talking to his elders about their recollections. He may also be a
musician and, if so, will spend time practising his craft. The skald has
his ears open for news of recent events, and his eyes on any behavioural
quirks of members of the jarl’s court. The skald performs one function
above all others – offering entertaining and irreverent commentary on
current affairs.
When the night draws in the jarl may preside over a feast and call
the skald to perform. The skald sings the sagas of the Norsemen
and plays sweet music. As mead flows the Northmen call for more
ribald entertainment and the skald employs his skills as a mimic and
comedian, mocking those in attendance, and even parodying the jarl
himself.
The skald treads a fine line. If he’s careful, he will be heaped with praise
and fame, and even given the honour of bearing the Jarl’s banner in
times of war. Most Northmen pride themselves on being able to take a
good joke, so the Skald is confident that his targets will probably take
it in good humour. However, if he takes his act too far, he may find
himself hewn apart by an offended reaver.
Affiliations
Skalds are almost always members of a Norse lord’s court, and so enjoy
the patronage of a jarl, king or warlord. This provides much needed
protection for the skald. This is a liability to, for if the skald seeks a
life of his own (by taking up adventuring, for example) he will have
effectively snubbed a very important Norseman.
Members of Norse society such as seers and vitki will tend to give skalds
a warm reception out of respect for their learning.
Adventure Seeds
Recite Your Way Out of This One: In the northlands, a crazed
champion of Slaanesh and his warband hunt a strange quarry. The
champion considers himself a connoisseur of music and song, and his
warband is known to capture and enslave bards, musicians and poets in
order to keep their lord entertained. Should word of a skald travelling
in the company of a party of adventurers reach this eccentric chaos
champion he will order a kidnapping. If the skald is abducted he will be
forced to write reams of hilarious verse to amuse his new patron, under
threat of painful and lingering death.
Dangerous Mockery: An old troll has learned to leave the Graelings
alone. It finds the meat of men tastier than elk, but is frightened of
being stung by their iron-tipped spears. Recently, the Graelings built
a huge wooden hall on the border of its territory, and on each eighth
evening singing and music can be heard from within. The troll comes
nearby to listen to the sweet music. Afterwards a man’s voice can be
heard, giving a speech to much laughter. The old Troll understands a
little Graeling tongue, and wonders who the ‘grotesque and lumpen
lonesome brute’ they mock so cruelly might be.

Slave
Oh, woe is me! What did I do to deserve this?
(CotHR) Without Slaves, Skaven society would collapse. These miserable wretches are bought and sold for
Warpstone Tokens on the slave blocks in the major communities of the Under-Empire. When they arrive at
their new homes they find endless toil and pain: clearing new tunnels, feeding the Rat Ogres, becoming food
for their masters, and serving as test subjects for some new Clan Skryre or Clan Moulder enterprise are only a
few of the many possible fates that await Skaven Slaves.

Career Exits: Clanrat, Clawleader, or Any (see special rules).
Special Rules: Unlike all the other new careers described in this chapter, any race can automatically enter this career. It costs no experience points to
enter, merely the circumstances of enslavement. Any character enslaved by the Skaven must succeed on a Will Power Test each week of enslavement,
or immediately exit their current career and assume this one. Non-Skaven Slaves must stay in this career until they somehow find a way to escape
captivity. Assuming they do, they can attempt a Will Power Test each week thereafter. A successful Test allows them to resume their previous careers.
A Day in the Life
A slave’s day starts when he is whipped awake from inadequate sleep,
and thrown disgusting, half-rotten food, which he must fight over
with his fellow slaves. The skaven go through the ranks, pulling out
the bodies of those who died in the night and cutting them out of the
chain. Sometimes the living slaves are allowed to feast on the bodies of
the dead; for many slaves this becomes their greatest hope.
The day is filled with hard labour, of whatever sort the overseers need.
Slaves who are not quickly put to back-breaking work become terrified,
because that means that they have been chosen for some experiment, or
as food. Those who die during the day are pulled from the chains when
the overseers notice, which may not be until the work is over. It is hard
to work chained to a corpse, but any slave who lets that slow him down
can expect a flogging.
When the day’s work ends the survivors are thrown food to fight over
once more, and then are allowed to drop into exhausted sleep where
they stand.
It is a bleak, hopeless existence. For the most desperate of slaves, death
becomes a more attractive option as time passes.
Little Known Facts
Many slaves of the skaven go mad, and a few even come to believe they
are skaven. Whispered rumours among the slaves say that those who
go truly mad are mutated into skaven as they sleep, and that the chains
are lost during the mutation. Some slaves see this as their only hope of
escape, and pretend to believe they are skaven in the hope that it will
break their minds.
The skaven do not separate male and female slaves, and very
occasionally a female slave becomes pregnant, although the poor
nutrition and hard work make this unlikely. Carrying a child to term
is even more unlikely, and human babies look like tasty treats to most
skaven. Nevertheless, there are a handful of children in the tunnels,
protected by a group of slaves as allies unbound by chains.
Adventure Seeds
Follow the Leader: While the slaves are clearing a tunnel the roof
collapses, killing the skaven overseers but leaving the slaves alive, albeit
chained together. The slaves would all be executed for killing the skaven
if they were caught, so escape is the only option. But with everyone
chained together, this requires perfect cooperation.
Dire News: The slave learns to speak Queekish, and can understand the
discussions of the skaven overseers. They seem to forget that the slaves
are even there, and talk about all kinds of things. Apart from skaven
gossip, the slave overhears many details of a plan to destroy an Imperial
town. At last he hears the name; his home town. Can he escape and take
a warning, and will anyone believe him if he does?

Slaver
Oh, a troublemaker? I bet you’d like me to unlock your shackles and give you a chance at my throat? Hah, that’s the spirit, lad!
You’ll make a grand gladiator! Keep that anger and you might even live to see next year!
(ToC) In the past, slavery was quite common in the Old World. The practice is as old as Humanity,
originating in the ancient empire of Khemri, and continued through the various civilisations that rose
and fell in the intervening years, leading to the present day. In an evolving economy, slavery is
simply impractical. In places like Bretonnia, serfs perform all the work and live lives little better
than slaves, but in the Empire, men and women, whilst Peasants, are in charge of their own
destinies. Of course, in some remote corners of the Old World, the practice flourishes. Araby
is famed for its flesh markets as is Sartosa and even some dark corners in Marienburg. The
Norsemen take slaves as well, either from surrendered adversaries or as plunder from one of
their raids. Occasionally, they have reason to traffic with unsavoury flesh dealers, and some
enterprising Norsemen take up the profession.

The Dragon Fleet of Valbrand Fireblade
The fierce Norse jarl, Valbrand Fireblade, leads a band of notorious
Graeling slavers, who board their longships every summer and
mercilessly raid the Old World from their northern strongholds in
search of gold and thralls.
These brutal Norsemen are without remorse or pity for their prey. Each
of their longships bears the figure-head of a red dragon breathing flame,
a symbol that has come to be feared throughout Kislev, the Empire and
beyond. Their raids become more daring with each passing year, and no
one seems able to repel them.
 The source of Valbrand’s might is his devotion to the daemon prince,
Surthrond, rumoured to be a fearsome half-giant, half-dragon minion
of Khorne. According to the rumours, Surthrond has granted Valbrand
a flaming sword as a reward for his loyalty. Such is the jarl’s renown
that whenever he requires crew for his raids, he simply has to visit any
Graeling settlement and hold aloft his fiery blade to attract a flock of
young warriors eager to set sail with him.
The slavers sell their captives as thralls to neighbouring tribes. There
are tales that they sometimes have dealings with the infamous Druchii
of far-away Naggaroth. It is also rumoured that Valbrand sacrifices the
choicest slaves before a great pyramid of burning skulls in the remote
tundra of the Graeling lands.
Turnabout is Fair Play
One of the most fearsome slavers to ravage the northernmost shores
of the Empire is Micah the Bloodied. Micah was himself once a slave,
captured at a young age in a remote village on a small island in the
Sea of Claws. Even in his youth he was impetuous and unruly. His
slavemaster cut off his hand to try and break the boy’s will.
Rather than subdue the lad, it only angered him. Micah picked up his
severed hand, launched himself at the startled slaver, and choked the
man with his dismembered hand. The rest of the slavers watched in
disbelief, and Micah slew two more before they returned to their senses.
Some of the captured slaves thought this was their opportunity to
escape – but Micah would have none of it. Grabbing a lash, he whipped
the slaves mercilessly until they eagerly sought refuge in their crowded
pens. Micah quickly assumed the role of the slavemaster he had slain.
The other slavers were intimidated by his ferocity and resilience to pain
and fear, and brooked no argument with their new peer.

Smuggler
Smuggling? I don’t know what you’re talking about!
(Core) Most of the sea and road trade of the Old World is subject to duties and taxes. Imperial tax
collectors, local excisemen, petty lords, and anyone with enough muscle can place a duty on
the movement of goods. Legal taxes are bad enough, but many pirates and Outlaw Chiefs also
demand a cut to allow safe passage. In large ports like Marienburg, nearly everything moving in
or out is taxed in some way. Given this state of affairs, the Smugglers’ trade continues to thrive.
While smuggling is, of course, illegal, most folks in the Empire don’t think much of cutting a few
corners. In their minds, the taxmen and bureaucrats are the real thieves.

Affiliations
Astute smugglers collect all manner of contacts, both shady and
aboveboard. Corrupt excisemen can be bribed to look the other way,
forgers provide official-looking customs papers, a fence can help move
goods that are too hot to sit on, and boatmen, stevedores and coachmen
can all help move merchandise surreptitiously, or can ensure that a crate
or two of the goods they are shipping are lost in transit, finding their
way into the smuggler’s hands.
Some merchants are happy to deal with smugglers as long as the profit
margin is high and there is little risk of getting caught. Crime lords
often run smuggling syndicates, and deal severely with those who run
illicit operations without their permission.
A Smuggler’s Reputation
Smugglers are viewed in many parts of the Old World as champions
of the oppressed. By resisting government interference in the free flow
of goods, they strike a blow against tyranny – or so a smuggler might
say. Smuggling is dangerous and illegal, and only the most shrewd
practitioners have long careers. Smugglers can expect to spend part
of their lives incarcerated for their crimes, if not exiled for the more
incorrigible cases.
Betrayal is a constant threat to a smuggler, as smugglers’ business
partners tend to get greedy from time to time, seeking to keep the whole
pie for themselves. A good smuggler doesn’t reveal how much he makes
on the sale of “imported goods” lest one of the many sets of hands that
must handle such cargo decide to keep a larger share for themselves.
Many smugglers, however, are under no delusions of heroism or
championing any cause other than their own. There is a powerful reason
smugglers assume the many risks their trade poses – there is always
ample gold to be made for those ambitious and brazen enough to
smuggle goods.

shipping criminals on the run to Marienburg aboard his caravel. The

drawn from the Peasant or Burgher classes. They man the Empire’s fortresses, patrol
the borders, and repel invaders. Most Soldiers of the infantry train with either the

A Day in the Life
During times of active military service, few careers may be as
demanding as the life of a soldier. However, outside the theatre of war,
the life of a soldier is often mired in dull routine and repetition. To
some soldiers, it’s not clear which life style is preferable.
Soldiers awake before dawn, quickly pulling on their uniforms, taking
up their weapons, and hustling to the staging yard for morning exercises
and drills. Drills vary from unit to unit, but often end with a forced
march with full kit and armour. After a quick break for breakfast, it’s
time to get back to work.
For those on duty, that means patrolling. For those off-duty it means
more drills. Soldiers practice with their unit’s weapon for several hours
each day. They rotate duties to keep any soldier from becoming too
complacent at his post, usually working in two- to three-hour shifts.
After a late dinner, soldiers not on duty have a few hours to themselves.
Most often this is spent drinking, dicing, and womanizing.
The only difference for a soldier during war is that instead of morning
exercises and drilling he is fighting. Otherwise their schedules remain
the same. Routine is the backbone of military life, and many soldiers
find the regularity comforting.
Affiliations
The largest affiliation for any soldier is of course his military unit.
Whether it is a local militia or the Imperial Army, that organisation
is the soldier’s fraternity. It supports him, trains him, protects him,
punishes him, and tends to him as necessary. Within each military
organisation, however, there may be smaller groups, and these are more
like real families. The most common small military group is the unit or
squad. This could be anywhere from four to twenty men, whom serve
under the same commanding officer and most often bear the same
weapons and fight using the same techniques. Squad members rely
upon one another completely in battle, and this closeness forges often
unbreakable bonds—many military wives complain their husbands are
closer to their squadmates than to them.
Beyond the military itself, soldiers may join other groups based on
their backgrounds and interests. Those who serve on a local militia are
often part of the neighbourhood watch or the city council, for example.
Soldiers with an interest in bars and pubs—owning them rather than
just drinking at them—might join the Tapsters Guild, at least as
associates. Many soldiers enjoy shooting clubs and hunting clubs, since
this allows them to keep their skills sharp even during peacetime.
Adventure Seeds
War is Coming!: The military is mobilizing, and all soldiers are being
recalled to active duty and being told to get ready for shipping out. But
where are they going, and who exactly are they fighting?
In Mixed Company: The soldier is ordered to accompany a group of
mercenaries on a private mission. He obeys, as this was a direct order
from his superiors. But soon it becomes apparent that these mercenaries
are up to something sinister. They are pressing the soldier about his
knowledge of the army’s barracks, munitions, watch schedules, and
other details that would allow a small group of miscreants to wreak
unimaginable chaos on the army camp.

The Emperor’s Eyes
While the Emperor’s armies defend the borders of his realm, an
unseen legion battles tirelessly to thwart the enemies within. These
agents, known as the Emperor’s Eyes by those aware of their existence,
confound those who plot against the Emperor, whether they be Chaos
cultists, treacherous nobles or populist agitators. In the court of every
Elector Count, in every guild building and meeting house where
malcontents rant against Imperial edicts, and even within the Colleges
of Magic, an Eye waits and watches. Knowledge is power, and Karl
Franz uses the Eyes to maximise his authority.
The Eyes answer to Duke Friedrich von Fuchs, undersecretary to
the Marshal of Altdorf, despatching intelligence to him scrawled in
complicated cipher using invisible ink. An Eye cannot afford to reveal
his true identity, and each carries a dose of arsenic. If an Eye is captured
during a mission, von Fuchs will send a fellow agent to silence him.
Eyes are recruited from all spheres of society. Most are merely paid
informers, but professional spies perform more sensitive work, masters
of subterfuge who can worm their way deep into a conspiracy. Duke
von Fuchs’s minions scour universities and guilds for candidates who
display the necessary intelligence, charm and ruthlessness. The duke
often uses blackmail to ensure the loyalty of new recruits, engineering
events that would ruin them should they be made public.
Emmanuel Blanck
The dashing baron became the talk of the ball when he stole a dance
with Duchess Feodora Elsenach. He even shared her carriage home!
But the scandal was forgotten the following morning with news of the
duchess’s arrest and incarceration within the Palace of Retribution.
Within a week, she was executed for high treason – condemned by
the discovery of an altar to an unspeakable deity hidden within her
bedchamber. The chattering classes agreed that the duchess’s mysterious
suitor had a hand in her demise, but nobody who had been at the ball
could remember anything about the man, who had disappeared as
though he never existed.
Emmanuel Blanck, spy extraordinaire by Imperial appointment, has
perfected the art of being forgettable. He has a thousand masks; with a
subtle frown or curl of the lip, he can transform his face. Using flattery
and conceit, he can engage a person in genial conversation for hours,
gleaning their innermost secrets while divulging nothing about himself.
Among his many achievements, he infiltrated the notorious Blackpowder
Plotters, saving the life of the Emperor himself. He toppled the
Conspiracy of Skulls, foiling a ritual to summon a Bloodthirster beneath
Altdorf’s Temple of Sigmar. He was also instrumental in influencing the
Boot Tax rioters of 2519 to lynch the very demagogues who had incited
them to violence.
Only the spy master, Duke von Fuchs, is aware of Blanck’s existence.
He calls upon his services in times of national crisis. The two never
meet – the duke communicates with the agent by means of an obscure
code flashed by lantern at dusk across Altdorf’s rooftops. When Blanck
signals that he has received his orders, von Fuchs is confident that he
will resolve the case with his trademark efficiency.

(Core) Squires are Knights in training. Often of Noble blood, they assist Knights on and off the field of battle.
Though they can appear to be nothing more than glorified Servants, fetching food and wine for their lord or

knighthood. Their lords are also supposed to provide them with martial training, though some are lax in this
duty. Favoured Noble sons serve as Squires for a few months at best, while those less fortunate spend years

A Day in the Life
A squire awakens very early in the morn, long before his lord stirs
from slumber. Although the squire learns much from his master, he is
both servant and student, and gains lessons as much from performing
mundane tasks as from careful instruction. If the squire is in his lord’s
manor, he might sharpen his master’s steel or prepare his master’s horse.
If on the road, he might cook his master’s breakfast or clean his clothes.
The squire always attends the immediate needs of his master as the day
begins.
During the day, a squire receives instruction on various matters, either
from his lord or his lord’s servants. The lord may instruct the squire
on topics of heraldry or history, and may let the squire observe affairs
conducted in his court. The lord’s master-at-arms could provide tutelage
with swords, both wielding and caring for them. A squire is expected
to learn to wage war with both weapons and words, and the lessons
learned reflect this belief.
At night, the squire gets to relax from a weary day. However, his lessons
do not always end. If not traveling with just his master, the squire finds
company with other squires of the court, comparing what they have
learned…and commiserating over the foolishness of some of their lesser
masters over a mug of ale. Squires have been known to try to catch
the eye of pretty ladies-in-waiting as well. Some lords view this with
approval as another lesson to be learned in a royal court – while others
may punish their charges for such brash behavior.
Affiliations
In a large court – or in a marshalled group of knights that is part of
an army – squires may be divided in various groups when assembled
together. Though this hierarchy is not official, it is something that is
understood, and part of tradition.
Younger squires may often be referred to as pages, and do not receive as
many hard physical acts of labor as the older squires do. These younger
squires act more as servants, and may be asked to be messengers on the
field of battle. Older squires may also be asked to fight for their lords,
but they would be expected to act more as scouts than messengers, and
to face down their enemies with drawn swords.
A squire’s social status may also affect his training, as well as the tasks
he is expected to perform. Squires of higher aristocratic lineage usually
receive less physical tasks as their duties, and their training in combat
revolves as much around the ability to lead and inspire soldiers as to
fight. Squires who comes from lesser noble families – or who might
even be of common blood – undertake more punishing physical
training, and are expected to be more fighters than leaders.
Adventure Seeds
A Suitable Steed: A lord’s prized charger is stolen the evening before a
jousting tournament. Irate, the lord sends his squire into the local town
to scour the stables for the missing horse, or to find a new one. The
lord demands that a suitable steed be ready for him at dawn, leaving the
squire to procure a horse by any means necessary.
The Missing Cousin: A lord’s prominent cousin arrives in a port city,
having come across the sea from a distant land. The squire is sent by
his lord to the port to bring this relative back to his lord’s court. When
the squire arrives, he learns that the lord’s cousin has incurred debt with
gamblers, and has gone missing.

Steppes Nomad
It is good our paths have crossed. Be wary travelling that way, for the steppes are thick with trolls this time of year.
(RotIQ) Uncounted krugs of Ungol nomads wander the frozen steppes of the Troll Country.
These tribesmen were pushed north when the Gospodars invaded and have roamed the
dangerous province ever since. There, they follow their domesticated herds from pasture
to pasture, chasing the warmth of Dazh, their patron, and settling briefly in portable huts
called kibitkas. They are a passionate and fierce folk, tempered by harsh surroundings and
endless conflicts with marauding kyazaks. By Kislevite law, every nomadic krug is expected to
annually form a rota of Kislev’s famed horse archers, which then patrols the northern oblast
every Spring Driving, ruthlessly slaughtering any invaders they encounter.
Special Requirements: You must be Ungol and you must be a member of a nomadic krug.

winds and the frigid temperatures. The steppe is also home to ravenous beasts and terrifying monsters, so steppe nomads wear leather jacks and
leggings for protection, and all carry at least a Kislevite horse bow with a quiver of 10 arrows.

Rumours from the Steppes
Every steppe nomad knows how to sew at least basic items, and carries a
bone or horn needle laced with sinew. This is most often used to stitch
wounds and perform first aid on the battlefield. But it is also handy
to be able to repair damaged yurts, since a torn yurta allows precious
warmth to escape.
Ungols enjoy drinking fermented yak’s milk, which has a surprisingly
powerful kick. They can drink prodigious amounts of more refined
alcoholic beverages without ill effect.
In addition to navigating by stars, experienced steppe nomads learn to
identify different northern winds and can actually determine both time
and direction by reading those winds, their strength, smell and their
direction.
The Ungol are a musical people—music and dance help relieve the
tedium of a long, harsh winter. Many steppe nomads attempt to learn
how to play some type of instrument for just such reasons. Horn pipes
and small leather drums are most common because of their durability
and portability.
Notable Figures
Kossamir the Ice Dervish was only a small boy when hobgoblin raiders
slaughtered his entire krug. He was wounded and left for dead, but
luckily was discovered by a wandering ice witch, who carried him to
her yurta, where she tended his wounds. When she had restored him
back to health, she ordered a nearby krug to take him in. Kossamir
grew to become a fine warrior and an asset to his adopted family, but
he continued to nurse his hatred towards hobgoblins, and his desire
for revenge grew stronger. When he was old enough, Kossamir took
his horse, his gear and his weapons and disappeared into the oblast. He
found a band of hobgoblin raiders and killed them all, his ferocity and
speed catching them by surprise.
It was not enough, however, and he continues to ride the north to this
day, attacking any greenskins he finds. He is legendary for his speed, his
accuracy and his complete disregard for personal safety—these and his
ability to survive the winter alone won him the name Ice Dervish. Many
young Ungol men look up to Kossamir and hope to become like him,
and killing hobgoblin raiders single-handed has become an unofficial
rite of manhood. Kossamir returns occasionally to his old krug, and
always responds to the call to join the annual rota. Otherwise he lives
and fights alone.
Adventure Seeds
Mysterious Tracks: Someone—or something—has attacked a small
krug! A steppe nomad is alerted to the sounds of battle, and investigates,
eager to lend aid in these troubling times. Upon his arrival, he finds
only horse tracks leading off toward a nearby frozen lake.
Breaking from Tradition: The call has gone out to form the annual
rota. Every steppe nomad is dutybound to respond, and to report for
service. But when they arrive they discover there was no call, at least
not as usual. A Sigmarite priest, far from the Empire, has somehow
stirred the passions of a few well-respected nomads, and seeks to lead
a rota of warriors northward to crush infidels and spread his zealous
religious doctrine.

Stevedore
None o’ yer lip, lad. Either help me get these crates down to the holds, or find a different pier to loiter on.
(WC) Stevedores are specialist dockers, trained to properly pack and unpack cargo holds. Loading a ship is skillintensive
and dangerous work, for vessels can overbalance and capsize if packed incorrectly, and unsecured cargoes
can crush the unwary. Within the claustrophobic ship interiors, Stevedores wind “stevedore lashings” (special knots)
with wedges of wood to secure and protect the heavy freight. Many Stevedors specialise in “porting” one type of
cargo, as each good requires different skills to manipulate, stack and pack correctly. Thus, most larger wharfs have
gangs of “porters” that identify themselves according to the goods they import or export, including fish
porters, meat porters and deal porters (for timber). None are more famous than the black-liveried coal
porters of Nuln, known for their anything-goes attitude and love of bawdy docker songs. Stevedores
wear distinctive cloth watch caps dyed with their gang colours, both to identify their allegiances and
to protect themselves from the elements. Stevedore gangs jealously guard their wharfs from rivals,
and it takes little provocation for them to dish out “lashings” of a different kind.
Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Stevedore for Boatman
with your GM’s approval.

Greta Gerstein
Six feet tall and solid muscle, Greta Gerstein is a formidable figure in
her stevedore gang in Marienburg. In fact, she is regarded as a strong
candidate for foreman one day. No one in her gang has a problem with
a woman among their ranks. At least, not once she proved that she
could pull her own weight during the daily grind of the back-breaking
labour stevedores face. Blackening a few eyes helped settle the remaining
arguments about her presence in the gang.
Greta’s rugged, tom boy exterior hides a gentler side. A side Greta
desperately keeps secret lest she lose the respect she has earned with her
gang. Greta is actually an educated lady from a minor noble house, a
former student who had to drop out of the university when her family
fell on rough financial times and could no longer afford her tuition.
Rather than return home and face the prospect of an arranged
marriage, Greta fled to the docks, looking to charter a boat and escape
her fate. But she was too poor to arrange passage, and had to work
to earn enough to eat and eke out a living. Over time, she came to
appreciate the joys of a simple life filled with clear goals, hard work and
camaraderie – but she is still fearful that some day her family may come
looking for her.
The Dark Side of the Dock Side
Competition is fierce for stevedores who make their living loading and
unloading merchant vessels. The dock space is limited, which means
only so many ships can dock at one time. Which in turn means there
are only so many potential clients. This limitation is one reason why
many stevedores form teams or gangs, offering a potential client a group
of strong arms for one competitive rate.
And while it might first appear that the manual labour a stevedore
performs could easily be fulfilled by any strong man, there is more skill
required than first meets the eye. Keeping one’s balance on the rolling
deck of a ship is sometimes difficult enough, made even moreso when
bearing heavy cargo. Stevedores also need to know how to quickly
and efficiently transfer the cargo into wains, carts, barges, coaches or
whatever other transportation the client provides.
In some trading cities, a well-organised stevedore gang may even
unofficially benefit from a certain level of immunity from legal
interference. If several members of a gang were arrested for a
tavern brawl that got out of hand, certain merchants might find it
more difficult to unload and move their goods. This is the sort of
inconvenience that some of the town councillors are willing to exert
their influence to avoid. The gangs that enjoy this sort of latitude may
end up pushing too far, however, and find themselves on the gallow
poles. After all, there are more guilds eager to take over whatever
business a troublesome gang was responsible for.
Adventure Seeds
A Broken Barrel: A stevedore is hired to port barrels of wine, but
some of the barrels handle completely wrongly; they weigh the right
amount, but that weight shifts in ways that barrels of wine don’t. The
contract didn’t include the standard bonus for black market work, so the
stevedore ”accidentally” drops and breaks open one of the barrels. An
assortment of misshapen bones tumble out of the broken barrel, looking
vaguely human, but with disturbing twists and knobs. What will the
stevedore do with this unsightly discovery?

Steward
This beef is nearly rotting, you oaf! His Lordship is entertaining the Elector Count himself this evening. If
you don’t get me fresh meat immediately, you’ll be on the menu!
(Core) A Steward is a household manager, entrusted with arranging all the bothersome everyday
details that Nobles and the very rich, such as successful Merchants or powerful clergy, cannot
be bothered to deal with. While a Noble Lord will often have no idea what he is worth or how
much it takes to upkeep his affairs and various holdings, his Steward will know down to the
last shilling. As wealthy Nobles tend to have far flung estates, some Stewards may be put in
charge of a property and left to their own devices for years at a time.

Responsibilities
The smooth running of an estate requires daily dealings with the
bureaucracy of the Empire: tax rolls must be kept in order, fines paid,
appeals penned, bribes handed out, and so on. In his master’s absence,
the steward must also hold court over internal disputes and enact
punishment and reparation. As his master’s representative, the steward’s
word is always final. He has significant leeway to act as he sees fit, as
long as it is in his master’s interests.
Stewards must constantly maintain a careful inventory of the estate’s
goods and holdings. In cities, the steward is required to make regular
visits to his master’s business interests dotted around town. In rural
areas, where an estate could comprise of vast tracts of land and isolated
farms, this might involve days of travel through dangerous terrain, with
an entourage of guards to repel bandits or control peasants enraged at
the latest increase in their tithes.
The steward will also be in charge of the estate’s protection. The
farms of a rural estate must be defended against raiders, and business
interests in the city must be protected against aggressive competitors. A
steward works tirelessly to maintain the efficient running of his master’s
possessions.
Reputation
A steward’s position of power is dependent on the master he serves,
and so his reputation is tied with that of his lord. The man who holds
stewardship in the name of a tyrant will be reviled by the people he
governs. He is often hated more than his master, because he is the daily
face of his master’s harsh edicts.
On the other hand, the steward of a just and temperate lord may be
held with esteem if he acts according to his master’s wil. However, there
are too many stewards who abuse their position.
The absent lord of an estate may be under the illusion that that his
holdings are being run efficiently, while in actuality his proxy is bleeding
his tenants white and creaming off the proceeds.
Adventure Seeds
A Brutish Master: A benevolent lord dies and leaves his rich estate
to his son, a vain and vicious brute. The estate’s steward is overworked
while his new master fritters away his inheritance. In his greed, the
son orders his steward to raise tithes and, worse, to cheat the Imperial
treasury of its dues. The steward is faced with the ruin of both the estate
and his own reputation. Thoughts of murder darken his heart – his
master must suffer an accident, but who can he trust to carry it out?
Who Will Rid Me of These Troublesome Dwarfs?: Dwarf
miners have squatted hilly territory on the steward’s estate, claiming an
ancestral tie to the hills that stretches back over a thousand years. They
are after the silver they have discovered there. The steward is desperate
to evict the squatters before the impending arrival of his master, and
offers a reward to anyone who can shift the dwarfs by any method that
does not incur an entry in their infamous Book of Grudges.

Streltsi
First, you use this, for the big bang, da? Then, when no more powder -- the axe! Nyet
trouble after that.
(RotIQ) The streltsi were originally a rota of kossars from Erengrad. Led by Boyar
Boydinov – an eccentric noble obsessed with the Empire – they wielded pole-axes
rather than axes, mirroring the halberds favoured by the State Regiments of Ostland.
In 2345 IC, whilst driving back a Chaos horde alongside Empire allies, the wide-eyed
boyar witnessed Imperial black powder for the first time. His kossars were changed
forever. Now, many years after the death of Boydinov, the streltsi are the foremost masters
of firearms in Kislev, weapons once viewed with fear and superstition. Soldiers from across
Kislev travel to Erengrad to earn the crossed “berdysh and handgun” badge, which is awarded to
any who train with the streltsi for more than two seasons.

Career Exits: Bounty Hunter, Chekist, Mercenary, Sergeant, Veteran, Watchman, Winged Lancer
A Day in the Life
The streltsi are no mercenaries or sell-swords... or sell-guns, as the
case may be. They are proud soldiers of Kislev, strong and loyal, and
disciplined in battle. They are rarely found wandering alone, though
a few will move on to other careers and take their skills with them.
Most, though, are found with their fellows. Streltsi are brothers, trained
together, fighting together and, when it happens, dying together, all of
which they accept with typical Kislevite fatalism.
Unless actively at war, the life of a streltsi is normally one of practise.
The firearms they carry, though well made, are still not entirely reliable,
and the streltsi must constantly check, clean and maintain them, as well
as each and every component of their uniform. They must also drill
with sword and berdysh, practising both formation firing and one-onone
melee combat.
Of course, all work and no play... streltsi are often stationed in larger
towns or villages, and even those on the cold frontier are rotated back
regularly. Streltsi who have the opportunity will spend their nights as
soldiers everywhere do, drinking, gambling and seeking comfort in the
arms of tavern girls. They tend to relax in the same way they fight – as
a group. It is rare to see a streltsi drinking alone; some say that it would
be wiser to kick a hungry bear in his private parts than to disturb a
solitary streltsi deep in his cups.
At war, the streltsi march with other troops, but also keep themselves
apart – they are elite, and have their own pack-boys, wagon trains, and
so on. They mark off their encampments when the army pitches camp
for the night, and few cross those lines of ribbon without good cause.
Little Known Facts
Every streltsi names his weapon, though not until after it has killed a
man – or at least been fired in war at an enemy. It is said that at that
time, the weapon tells the wielder its name. Using a fellow streltsi’s
gun can be done in times of crisis, but it is said that doing so without
permission is a worse offense than sleeping with his wife.
The streltsi can shift suddenly from a disciplined line of calm, almost
machine-like handgunners to a raging horde of axe-wielding berserkers
in an instant, often terrifying even those foes brave enough to cross the
wall of gunfire they lay down.
Adventure Seeds
The Stolen Gun: “What do you call a streltsi without a gun? A
maniac who has to look you in the eye to kill you.” Well, there is one
such maniac tearing apart the town. His weapon, Anyanka, was stolen
from him during a particularly blurry drunken brawl, and he wants it
back. His regiment is shipping out in a day, and he refuses to take a
replacement from stores – he must have his gun back. Right now, it’s
just him on the rampage, but in a few hours, his partners will shake off
their hangovers and join in the search. Anyone who wants the town to
be standing will make sure he finds his gun!
Cut Off: A unit of streltsi has found itself stuck behind enemy lines,
and is trying to get back. Normally, they’d be happy to go out in a blaze
of glory, but they also carry information vital to the war – a pack of
maps and documents revealing hidden Chaos encampments and lines of
attack. If they all die bravely and foolishly, the word will not reach their
commanders, and they can’t allow that. The characters are employed to
go behind enemy lines and lead them back to safety.

Strigany Mystic
I sense a cloud of evil in this place … beware the dead, for they walk among you wearing the faces of the living.
(NDM) The people of Strigos were scattered to the winds when their lands were destroyed and have since taken up a nomadic life. They roam the Empire
in caravan trains or river barges, making money where they can and stealing when they can’t. Their history under the Vampires ensures they maintain
their travelling lifestyle, marking them not just as thieves and cutthroats but also necromancers and servants
of darkness. In truth, most of them are simple woodsmen, entertainers, or vagabonds, but a few do
know something of witchcraft, a little of fortune telling, and a large amount of Vampire lore.
These mystics were taught the true and complete history of their people, and they carry the secret
knowledge from those ancient days, as well as the promise of their Strigos lords to one day
return and lead them back to glory.
Note: Strigany mystic is only available to those of Strigany blood. Being of that blood
imposes a –10% penalty to all Fellowship Tests when dealing with a person of the
Empire. With your GM’s permission, you may substitute Strigany mystic for vagabond
when rolling for your Starting Career. If you have the WFRP Companion, you may

In Other Realms
Strigany mystics in the Empire receive mixed reactions from the
populace. Mostly, what little is known of the mystics by average
commoners is a legacy of thievery and witchcraft. At best, a mystic
entering a village in the Empire is greeted with suspicion…at worst,
with a knife. Some well-placed gold crowns with the local thieves’ guild,
though, may transform that distrust into curiosity…and opportunity.
In Norsca and parts of Kislev, it is not unusual for Strigany mystics
to be warmly greeted by the common folk of small villages. To the
villagers, the mystics are less enigmatic than the ice witches, and if the
mystics’ deeds benefit their own fortunes, the mystics are rewarded.
However, should they draw attention to themselves – particularly in a
larger city – they may attract the wrath of the ice witches, who view the
Strigany mystics as threats.
The various dukedoms of Bretonnia, though, the mystic is ill regarded.
To the people of Bretonnia, a Strigany mystic is no different than a
witch. Should a mystic reveal any sort of perceived supernatural ability,
such as fortune telling, retribution is sure to be swift and absolute.
Mystics in Bretonnia seeking survival should find a noble patron for
protection.
Notable Figures
Taciana Stirbei is perhaps the only Strigany mystic of renown in the
major cities of the Empire. Her travels have led her through Nuln,
Talabheim and even Altdorf.
It was in Altdorf that her beauty and fiery personality warmed the hearts
of several magisters from the Colleges of Magic. Though most esteemed
wizards from the Colleges patently deny the mystical abilities Taciana
claims to have, they must concede that her ability to perform seemingly
simple divinations with naught but a deck of cards is uncanny.
For a short time, Taciana’s novelty made her a fixture at noble parties
and events, where she dressed in finery and danced with the nobility.
Though many looked down upon her due to her lowly heritage, her
prescient abilities intrigued enough nobles to gain her invitation to such
events. She entertained a number of patrons – and lovers – who pay her
handsomely for even a hint of their futures.
That seems ages ago now. Once the novelty wore off, Taciana found
herself replaced by other fads and fashions. But she had grown
accustomed to life in the city, and remains in Altdorf. Falling out of
favour of the nobility and social elite has relegated her to the poorer
sections of Altdolf, talking to anyone and everyone, telling fortunes for
a copper per card from her worn deck.

An Ancient Spear: While digging a well, a farmer discovers an ancient
spear. Though it does not appear to be enchanted, the weapon is always
cold to the touch. The farmer has the spear hidden in his hovel, but
over the last few days, the farmer’s family has become pale, listless
and fatigued. Not knowing who else to turn to, the farmer turns to
a Strigany mystic, who foretold of a foul harvest for the farmer the

Student
Psst... Wilhelm – what answer did you get for question eleven?
(Core) The great cities of the Empire have many universities. Most, like the Imperial School of Engineers in Altdorf,
are funded by the state. The first college in the Empire was established in Nuln and that city is still famous for its
learning institutions (and, ironically, its Imperial Gunnery School). Students across the Empire can choose from a
wide variety of courses, from history to anatomy to science. Of course, many study nothing more than the bottom
of a bottle and wash out of school in less than a year. Elven Students don’t go to Imperial universities, but learn from
their own loremasters instead. Halfling students are admitted to Universities on sufferance, due to an obscure piece of
Imperial Ordinance demanded by the Elder of the Moot.

The Imperial Degree
Being a student is one thing, but being a student who completes a
degree is another entirely. The taverns and flop houses of the Old World
are filled with adventurers with partial and unfinished degrees. An
Imperial degree is a legal document from an accredited university that
verifies a student’s successful completion of a comprehensive program in
a specific field of study.
Basic literacy is a general requirement for admission to all Imperial
universities. There are basic and advanced degrees available to the
student with the appropriate prerequisites. A student may earn multiple
degrees over their careers, and compare them with fellow academic
colleagues as badges of honour. However, a student’s learning is often
limited by available funds to pay tuition, rather than a lack of ambition.
The Wissenburg Schoolmaster
As a former sergeant in the Nuln standing army, Nicolai Kessler had
seen his share of good men cut down by the inexperienced leadership of
spoiled young lords. Time and again Nicolai overstepped his station to
forcefully mentor his fresh-faced commanders in “everything they don’t
teach at the War College.”
Before long, the 21st Nuln Handgunners earned a reputation for
producing reliable officers, and Nicolai became affectionately known as
the “Wissenburg Schoolmaster”. Although he would never admit it, the
name had an unfortunate irony that annoyed the proud sergeant, since
he could neither read nor write.
But then the Battle of Nuln Fields changed everything. Nicolai awoke
among the Shallyans without his left eye or hand. Although his bravery
and sober action had saved many lives, Nicolai despaired. He knew his
time in the army was over, and there would be no one else to challenge
the stubborn young lordlings and shape them into leaders of men. For
his bravery in battle, Nicolai was granted a sizable pension.
The men who served under him had such great esteem for their
sergeant that they petitioned the Countess von Liebwitz to award him
a scholarship to the university. But sadly, the petition had to be rejected
since literacy was a requirement for admission, and the Wissenburg
Schoolmaster could not read.
When Nicolai’s former commanders learned of his plight, they
organised a new petition and lent their considerable family influence to
his appeal. The officers declared that Nicolai must be allowed to enter
the university, were he rose in the professorial ranks and continued his
instruction in everything they don’t teach at the War College.

Swamp Skimmer
A fish hook, an old hat, a notched sword blade and two bronze clanks. All in all, a good
morning’s work.
(RC) Of all the terrain found in the Borderlands, few are as nasty and inhospitable as
its swamps and fens. Polluted stretches of land, filled with bloodsucking mosquitoes
and ravenous leeches, they are breeding grounds for disease. Since these places are
generally left alone, there are all sorts of treasures and oddities lurking beneath
the vines and brackish water, and those with the mettle and constitution to resist
the disease and vermin that infest these places find they can make a good living.
Collectively known as Swamp Skimmers, these men and women brave the hostile
environment in the hopes of bettering themselves and perhaps buying passage out of
this dangerous land.

A Dangerous Lifestyle
In civilised lands, ‘swamp skimmer’ is a bruising insult, but in the
Border Princes it is a profession which offers escape from grinding
poverty. For every skimmer who is lured to a watery grave by a corpse
candle, or whose white bones mark the entrance of a beast’s lair, there is
another who returns, muddy and mosquito-bitten, clutching a rusting
sword or battered helmet which will earn him a few shillings.
There are tales of a realm which once spanned from the desert regions
of the far south to the edge of what is now the Empire, whose soldiers
marched to war in armour of bronze and gold. Once in a while, a
skimmer discovers the remnants of this lost civilisation; he jealously
guards the ruins’ location, but it is only a matter of time before others
converge on the find and strip it bare. Many fail to return: the dead rest
uneasy in the fens.
Skimmers tired of scouring the marshes bide their time until
the inevitable adventuring party arrives in their locale, intent on
exploration. The skimmers follow their tracks, which usually lead to
their chewed corpses. Once the swamp predators have had their fill, the
skimmers move in to loot what’s left.
Maxen Widerlich
The murderer, Maxen Widerlich, fled the Emperor’s justice by escaping
to the Border Princes, where he discovered he could make a passable
living skimming the badland swamps for valuable detritus. He would
have remained a nameless treasure hunter had it not been for his chance
discovery of a circle of metal sticking out of the mud. Pulling it free and
wiping it clean, he noticed that it gleamed yellow in the wan sunlight: a
circlet of pure gold!
Excited, he traced the strange runes that encircled the band, and felt
a strange compulsion to place it around his head. The crown fitted
perfectly, but seemed to contract around Widderlich’s skull, and his
agonised screams echoed through the marsh as he tried to rip it off. His
screams seemed to stir the surface of the mire. Rising slowly from the
mud, a thousand skeletal warriors in antique armour, wielding weapons
of bronze, surrounded him. The flesh sloughed from Widderlich’s face,
but he did not die. Grinning, the fiend he had become surveyed the
troops. With a silent order from its risen master, the horde marched out
of the swamp and descended upon the fortress of Baron Turme. The
castle was swiftly overrun, and soon a new baron held sway: the fleshless
tyrant Widderlich, who to this day carves out an empire for himself
with his undead force.
Swamp skimmers regard Widderlich’s fate as a cautionary tale, but many
secretly envy the man – they consider the sacrifice of his eternal soul a
small price to pay for the power he now wields.
Adventure Seeds
Treacherous Guides: A band of swamp skimmers spread rumours of a
sunken treasure in a badlands marsh to attract gold-hungry adventurers.
They volunteer as guides for the party that falls for the bait, leading
them deep into the swamp before leaving them at the mercy of the
swamp’s ferocious fauna. The skimmers hope to return a few days later
to strip the corpses of anything of value.
Hunt for the Fire Drake: A dwarf zeppelin, the Fire Drake, en route
from Barak-Varr to Karak Norn, has crashed in the swamps of the
Border Princes. The adventurers have been hired to rescue any survivors,
and recover the cargo of precious gromril. They must race to reach the
wreck before the swamp skimmers pillage it.

Swampaire
No, no … over there. See that darker patch of mud? That’s where you’ll find the fattest frogs. Fine enough for a prince to
eat, they are!
(BotD) Swampaires are hunters and gatherers of snails and frogs. They take their name from an obscure
dialect that essentially means man of the swamps or, more commonly, chaser of frogs. Snails and frogs are
the only resource in which Mousillon is rich, and swamping is a prestigious occupation among its peasants.
Since all creatures in a swamp are technically owned by the local lord, a Swampaire needs at least the implicit
approval of the local noble. Some nobles require lengthy apprenticeships and the swearing of oaths before
a man can call himself a Swampaire and be permitted to hunt his lord’s swamps. Swampaires tend to be
hardy folk adept at tracking snails and frogs, which is a tricky and time-consuming business at the best of
times. Swampaires are normally men, but some nobles have been known to permit a particularly sharpeyed
and quick-fingered lass to hunt in the absence of suitably skilled menfolk.
With your GM’s permission, when rolling your starting career you can substitute Swampaire for Hunter.

A Day in the Life
Swampaires are the hunters of Mousillon, toiling to catch their prey
from dusk until dawn. Though foreigners may scoff at the notion of
men grubbing in the dirt for frogs and lizards, the folk of Mousillon
revere the swampaires for their skill and patience.
The swampaires’ day begins before the sunrise, where they rely more on
their ears than their eyes to locate their prey. Listening for the croaks
and chirps of frogs, they wind their way through the marshes, snagging
some of the larger creatures that thought themselves safe in the dark
with their bare hands.
As the day breaks, the swampaires’ tactics shift as the creatures they
seek begin to move. The diligent hunters search rocks and sandy areas
near the outskirts of their swamps, collecting snails from the shadows
and slow-moving turtles basking in the sun. They also set new snares in
the water as they trudge through their hunting grounds, and claim the
creatures caught in older traps.
With traps set and with quarry ensnared, the swampaires eventually
return to their villages. They head immediately to the marketplaces
or the manors of their lords, in order to prepare and clean their odd
bounty. Once their ministrations are complete, their daily catches are fit
to be sold or cooked as needed.
Despite the long and arduous work, the swampaires are able to relax
with a good cup of mead when night finally falls, often in the company
of many friends. Swampaires are on many occasions the primary source
of trade and income for a small village, and while not of royal blood,
are often treated as such by their fellow villagers. The prestige of the
swampaires gives them a certain amount of authority in times of crisis…
although such authority can often be abused.
Affiliations
In Mousillon, the title of swampaire is one to be earned, not given. It is
rare that one simply becomes a swampaire – the fine art of hunting frogs
and snails is deceptively difficult. Young children may be apprenticed
at an early age to a swampaire in order to learn the tricks of the trade,
working closely with their master to learn their secrets.
In a larger community where several swampaires reside, the collective
group of hunters forms small guilds that delineate specific hunting
territories. In these arrangements, swampaires may either only hunt in
certain portions of a swamp or only at certain times, with a swampaire
incurring financial penalty should he break these rules.
Guilds may also split hunting territories, particularly where older and
younger swampaires exist. In such cases, the younger swampaire would
set traps and hunt the swamps, while the older swampaire would
prepare the creatures caught and sell them at the marketplace.
Adventure Seeds
Curse of the Black Frogs: Local farmlands have been overrun by
unusual amounts of strange black frogs, that spew forth dark spittle
when they croak. Though the frogs do not appear to be dangerous
to the farmers, their sheer numbers have ruined many crops. The
swampaire is sent to find the source of the black frogs in the nearby
marshes.
Scarecrows: During the summers, the local marshes begin to dry up.
Recently, though, the marshes have dried even more than usual, and
a few children claim that scarecrows wander through the dried mud
where snails and frogs once lived. The swampaire needs to find where
the waters have gone, and learn the truth about these mysterious
scarecrows…

(Core) Targeteers dedicate themselves to perfecting their skill with missile weapons, most often
the mighty longbow, though a rare few prefer the crossbow. They regularly travel to different
fairs, delighting crowds with their trick shooting and pitting their skills against all-comers in
impromptu contests. Many Nobles regularly hold archery tourneys with a fair purse to the
winner and a professional Targeteer can make a decent living if he is skilled enough to
regularly claim a prize or two. In these grim times, a Targeteer’s uncanny skill with a bow is
in high demand among armies and Mercenary companies.

Rathiel Whitebow
If there is a better archer in the Old World than Rathiel Whitebow, that
archer has kept his identity a secret. The elf is a master of the longbow
with few peers even amongst his own kin. He has made the weapon the
focus of his life, neglecting family, friends, or any other loyalty.
His all-consuming arrogance is such that he will never refuse a challenge
of his skills. He will settle for mere target shooting but prefers a duel of
arrows. Because of this, Rathiel has killed at least a half dozen men and
elves over the last few years and wounded far more. This has made his
reputation as a highly dangerous outlaw.
Rathiel is on a quest. He is searching for a legendary magical bow
known only by the cryptic name The Song of Storms. Whether this
weapon is real or simply a product of Rathiel’s obsession is difficult
to say. What is certain is that Rathiel broke into a bookseller’s shop
in Brionne and since then has been seen trekking towards the Border
Princes. His exact destination remains uncertain to anyone but himself.
The Elven Fair
A common story amongst archers, woodsmen, and targeteers is that
once every decade, the elves of Athel Loren hold an archery contest.
In the elves’ own tongue this is called the Mureth Vai, and it is said
to be an affair of rare magnificence and fey splendour. The elven lords
and ladies gather to watch the tournament and to revel beneath the
midsummer moon.
The prize, the storytellers whisper around campfires, is always the
same – a an elven bow of unparalleled craftsmanship, made from the
heartwood of a tree older than any human kingdom. The tournament is
an open invitation and anyone who can brave the dangers of the forest
is welcome to participate, even humans. No human in living memory
has ever won the tournament.
Indeed precious few can even honestly claim to have entered the Mureth
Vai, and whether this tournament is even real is a matter of discussion.
But if it were real, then whoever won it would likely be the Old World’s
greatest archer.
Adventure Seeds
The Competition: The local lord has decided that he wishes to
encourage archery within his domain. To this end, he has announced a
fair and archery tournament. The grand prize is an almost unimaginable
sum of money – one thousand gold crowns! Targeteers from across the
Empire gather, and that is when the cheating and violence begins.
A Tale of Revenge and Betrayal: A targeteer wants one of the party
dead to avenge the death of his brother. He has procured a deadly
poison and now he just has to find the right moment to ambush the
party and deliver his vengeance. However, the crime lord who sold the
poison to the targeteer has decided to sell out the archer. He is willing
to give the party the antidote to the poison, if only they’ll help him with
one trivial errand…

Temple Guardian
Form a single queue please, ladies, and stop the shoving. The relic isn’t going anywhere.
(ToS) Temple Guardians are chosen, not from amongst the brightest members
of a congregation, who would be far better put to use elsewhere, but rather from
among those whose skills lie in a more physical area. They are expected to be above
reproach, and to resist the temptation to steal from their own temples. Some cults
ensure this behaviour by telling particularly horrid tales of the fate that awaits such
traitors in the afterlife, while others simply encourage temple guardians to keep a close
eye on one another, rewarding with great wealth any accusation of theft or disloyalty that
proves to be true..

A Day in the Life
A temple guardian’s daily routine begins with directing gathered
worshippers to make way for arriving priests. The rest of the guardian’s
day is spent patrolling temple grounds or performing watch duties
near important holy relics. There is never a shortage of time for temple
guardians to contemplate spiritual matters. Guard shifts usually change
at mid-day and again at evening prayer. At temples requiring constant
security, a midnight shift is also added.
Temple guardians are often the ones responsible for ringing the bell or
gong to announce prayer ceremonies. Guardians may also be requested
to escort priests on errands to the less savoury districts of a town or city.
When a temple’s priesthood is involved in wars or crusades, the temple
guardians carry palanquins or magical altars onto the battlefield.
Customs and Uniforms
Manann: Manann’s temple guards are often called upon to board
suspect vessels arriving at port, for sailors are reluctant to challenge
them. Uniforms are sea-green tabards worn over simple clothes.
Morr: The Black Guards are Morr’s elite temple sentries, but the cult’s
smaller chapels and burial grounds are watched over by lower-ranked
guards wearing black uniforms with hooded cowls.
Myrmidia: The temple guardians of Myrmidia are known for their
elaborate spear-passing ceremonies. They wear white or yellow tunics
with an eagle emblem embroidered on the breast or shoulder.
Ranald: Since Ranald’s cult doesn’t operate traditional temples, its
guardians are motley thugs tasked with guiding worshippers to sewers,
basements and dark alleyways where the god’s shrines are concealed.
Shallya: The few men who serve in Shallya’s temples tend to be
guardians. Their actual roles are closer to hospital wardens, aiding the
priestesses as needed. They wear white togas and carry only daggers.
Sigmar: Sigmar’s temple guardians are mostly zealous followers
recruited from the town watch or militia. Uniforms consist of tabards
coloured in red or blue with black details, and are often adorned with
litanies and purity seals.
Taal and Rhya: Young hunters and woodsmen are expected to serve
terms as temple guardians of Taal and Rhya. Their clothing is plain and
nondescript, aside from the leather straps around their arms.
Ulric: Temple guardians of Ulric wear long, plaited beards and howl
like wolves before evening prayers. Their uniforms include heavy grey
jackets and breeches, usually trimmed with fur.
Verena: Temples of Verena may only be guarded by those who have
never been convicted of a crime. The guardians wear purple or blue
robes and have oaths tattooed on their hands.
Adventure Seeds
An Inside Job: A treasure is stolen from a Sigmarite temple and the
temple guardian is framed for the theft. Unless the temple guardian can

and possibly mutilated. Investigation leads the guardian to discover that
the real thief is one of the temple’s own priests.

Thief
If he really wanted to keep it, he’d take better care of it. He left it in a strongbox where anyone could find it.
(Core) The Empire is home to many honest, hard working citizens and Thieves are dedicated to taking as
much of their money as possible. They tend to be jacks-of-all-trades, willing and able to take advantage
of any moneymaking opportunity that comes along. Specialist Thieves include blackmailers,
embezzlers, kidnappers, pickpockets, and cattle thieves. Towns and cities of any size have Thieves’
Guilds, which control and organize criminal activity. A few towns have more than one guild, which
leads to vicious fighting until one guild eliminates its rival. The most successful Thieves’ Guilds own
so many legitimate businesses that over time they turn into Merchant Guilds. It is a rare guild that
leaves its larcenous ways behind, however.

Affiliations
Thieves belong to thieves’ guilds. They have little choice – the guilds are
much better at finding thieves than the watch, and insist that all active
criminals take advantage of the benefits of membership.
If a city has more than one guild, both normally insist that every thief
join them, and not the other. This leads to gang warfare, so in a few
cities two guilds ignore each others’ existence. Thieves in the city must
belong to both, but pretend not to know about the other guild. The
masters of one guild are low-ranking members of the other, and are
generally left alone. Thieves have to pay two sets of dues, and may be
given tasks by both guilds at once, making it difficult for them to avoid
offending someone.
In a few cases the guild has become rich through respectable businesses,
and has a great deal of influence with the legitimate government of the
town. Indeed, a handful of towns are actually run by the thieves’ guild,
in which case the watch is only concerned with unlicensed criminality.
Normally, such towns collapse into anarchy, as the guild allows too
much crime, but in a few cases the leadership impose stability and a
reasonable level of lawbreaking. This often leads to a splinter guild
forming, to protect the rights of dishonest thieving folk.
Travelling thieves have to come to an arrangement with every guild
they meet. Sometimes this is easy, if the guild requires nothing but a
percentage. Others, the majority, impose significant ordeals on potential
members, and taking one of those trials every couple of weeks is bad for
the health. Travelling thieves thus often try to avoid the notice of guilds
as well as the watch.
Murdbelly Furrows
Murdbelly is a halfling thief active in Stirland. He is a member of the
thieves’ guilds of more than half a dozen towns, and constantly on the
run ahead of the enforcers. He does enough towards paying his dues
in each place to make finding him a low priority, so he has stayed alive
for now. He knows a lot about many thieves’ guilds, and although law
enforcement does not know about him yet, this is going to occur to
one of the guilds at some point. Murdbelly himself is too busy trying to
juggle his obligations to worry about such long-term issues.

the thief and his companions set off to return the bag, stop the ritual
themselves, or just deal with the daemon when it comes looking for

On the Other Hand...: The thief is caught, but the magistrate gives
him a choice between losing a hand and doing a little job. The job
involves finding proof that a certain secret society is worshipping

A Day in the Life
The life of a thug is one of casual violence and the instant gratification,
broken up by periods of abject terror, excruciating pain, and sometimes
death. A thug spends much of his time wandering around the city,
either at the behest of his boss or following his whims.
He spends his time intimidating shopkeepers, watchmen, and residences
just to let them know what (and who) waits for them if they step out of
line. After dark he will wander around the poorly lit and patrolled areas
of the city looking for targets of opportunity. However, a canny thug
spends a bit of time shadowing his mark before he strikes.
After all, no sense in getting a sword in the gut. Once a likely mark
is spotted, the thug roughs him up before making off with whatever
he can carry. The day (or night) typically ends with the thug drinking
himself into oblivion on his ill-gotten gains before finding a dark corner
to pass out in, hopefully avoiding becoming a victim himself.
The Deadfish
The Deadfish are a typical example of an Empire city gang, preying on
the weak, cowering from the strong, and generally ruling over a few
refuse-filled streets and their equally poxy residents. The Deadfish claim
three blocks in Nuln between the old iron smelt on Aver Street and the
narrow canal near the shot tower.
Of course this can, and usually does, change on a daily basis depending
on the mood of the watch, rival gangs, and the weather (few can stand
the smell of the canal on a hot day). The leader of the gang is Bollo, a
grizzled old thug missing more than a few appendages – an ear, a nose,
most of his teeth, and a large flap of his scalp. Under Bollo a band of a
dozen or so thugs do most of the gang’s leg work, collecting ‘protection’
money from shopkeepers, letting residents know where they can and
can’t go, and most importantly preying on travellers foolish enough to
wander into the neighbourhood, especially after dark.
Then there is the small army of gutter snipes, beggars, and weevil-men
the gang uses. They can be found on every street corner and in every
drinking hole. They act as pickpockets, informers, and con men for
the gang, with a thug or two always nearby should a mark get out of
hand. Periodically the watch will crack down on the gang and there will
be arrests and hangings. Of course somehow Bollo is never one of the
unlucky ones, and the Deadfish invariably surface once again.

A Day in the Life
The problem with being a toll keeper is that you live in the middle of
nowhere, with no one for support or relief. The good news is that you
live in the middle of nowhere, with no one to oversee you or boss you
around. Being a toll keeper is bad enough that most men in the job take
advantage of the few perks it offers. One of those is setting your own
hours. The toll keeper’s booth is usually set up right beside the road, at
a point where it is impossible to pass to the side instead due to thick
trees, heavy rocks, sheer drops, or some combination thereof. A heavy
beam blocks the road itself, worked by a winch in the tollbooth. Thus
anyone wanting to take that road must pay the toll, which means they
must wait upon the toll keeper’s pleasure. Because of this, particularly
smug toll keepers rarely get out of bed before dawn, and often take their
time washing and dressing and breakfasting. Then they stroll out of
their house and across to the booth, unlock the door, let themselves in,
lock the door behind them, and finally unlock and open the small side
window. Now they are finally ready for business.
After that the day passes into tedium. Toll keepers can see people
approaching for a good distance, so they can get out of their booth
from time to time to stretch their legs. The minute they see travellers,
however, they hurry back to the booth and lock themselves in. After
all, you never know who is willing to pay the toll and who will turn
to violence instead. The toll keeper sits inside his little fortified booth,
charging each traveller before raising the gate, and watching the road
the rest of the time. Bandits often attack tollbooths, so it’s important to
stay alert and not to venture too far from the booth’s protection.
By the time dusk settles, the toll keeper is done. He pours the day’s tolls
into a sack, locks the tollbooth behind him as he exits, and carries the
money back to his house, where he counts it and records the amount.
Then he is free to eat, drink, and do whatever else he likes before
turning in. Few men can stand the solitude and constant danger long,
which is why most toll keepers only last a few years at best.
Notable Figures
Hertzog Brenmuller was a roadwarden for several years before he was
awarded his own tollbooth. After years of pacing long stretches of
road, he was pleased to settle down. Hertzog is a quiet man who enjoys
reading and woodcarving, and he immediately took to the isolated life
of a toll keeper. He whittles and carves while sitting in his booth, and
has decorated the booth itself, transforming its solid wood surface into
a fantastical menagerie. Of course he is no fool, and so he also whittles
crossbow bolts—a large supply of them sit on the table in front of him,
right beside the two crossbows he keeps loaded. Only a few brigands
have been desperate enough to attack Hertzog, and they did not live to
tell of their failure, but their bodies, stripped and staked along the road,
warns away others of their kind.

The Greatest Toll: A stranger staggers up to a tollbooth and collapses,

Tomb Robber
The dead weren’t going to be using that jewellery anyway.
(Core) Tomb Robbers differ from Grave Robbers in that they are interested in the valuables to be found in
burial sites rather than the bodies themselves. Although very few graves in the Old World include valuable
goods these days, there are many ancient burial sites that contain priceless treasures. Tomb Robbers are
experts in locating such sites and plundering their riches. Secret tombs are usually in dangerous and
inaccessible areas. Those within the Empire’s borders are revered and protected by local inhabitants, so
accessing these sites can be just as dangerous. Clever traps and deceptions protect the richest tombs
and skilled Tomb Robbers must learn to disarm or bypass them. Few survive long enough to raid more
than one tomb.

Greed & Glory
The universal motivation of the tomb robber is most often greed, but
even greed comes in many forms.
Wealth: The greed driving most tomb robbers is the simple lust for
gold, and anyone wealthy enough to have a crypt erected in his name
is also wealthy enough to rob—or so goes the logic. Many earlier
civilisations entombed their kings and potentates amidst vast material
wealth. Jewellery, precious metal craftwork, and the priceless relics of a
forgotten age can be converted into to a fortune with the right buyers.
Power: Another common motivation for tomb robbers is the greed for
power. Many great heroes and villains have been raised from obscurity
by the discovery of powerful magical artefacts secreted away in the
deepest vaults of the Old World. Typically these tomb robbers concern
themselves with the penetration of the ancient Dwarven households.
Everyone who has ever set foot in an Imperial Alehouse has heard tales
of the ancient Dwarven heroes and their potent Rune weapons.
Knowledge: The least common, but most insidious motivation for the
tomb robber is the quest for forbidden knowledge. Whether it is for
personal gain or at the behest of a secret client, much of the knowledge
contained in the arcane scrolls and tomes hidden beneath the ground
would best remain undiscovered. Forbidden Chaos lore and the lost
secrets of Necromancy are examples of the hidden knowledge awaiting
the intrepid tomb robber.
The Ghost of Grenzstadt
The Fortress Town of Grenzstadt is not a large town by any measure,
but its strategic location at the base of Blackfire Pass has transformed
it into a bustling marketplace and gateway to the Empire. The town’s
cosmopolitan mix of foreign merchants, trade caravans, and pilgrims
also provides cover to one of the Empire’s largest black markets for
plundered Dwarfen treasures.
While it’s true that tomb robbers are despised throughout the Old
World, the Dwarfs hold a special enmity for those who would despoil
their sacred vaults. As such, Karaz-a-Karak has deployed a detachment
of Dwarfen Lawbringers to Grenzstad, in an effort to curb this
disturbing trend.
The results of this deployment have been somewhat mixed. The
Dwarfs have recovered many ancestral treasures, yet one tomb robber
continues to evade them – the Ghost of Grenzstadt. Whether the
Ghost of Grenzstadt is a lone individual or a team of despoilers is
unknown. The only reliable information the Dwarfs have gleaned about
the Ghost is that he or she is an experienced tomb robber specialising
in the acquisition of Dwarfen artefacts from ancient ruins scattered
throughout the pass.
Adventure Seeds
The Ancestral Crypt: A young noble has incurred massive gambling
debt and seeks a way out. The noble has an extensive list of family
heirlooms buried in his ancestral crypt, and will provide details and split
the proceeds if he can find the right man for the job.
Hidden Reserves: A group of drunken adventurers has been seen
around town celebrating and buying drinks with gold coins of a
mysterious origin. If these amateur tomb robbers haven’t cleaned out
their discovery, it won’t be long before more seasoned professionals do.

Tradesman
Trade’s the lifesblood of the Empire. Think of me as a leech-man-doctor who keeps that blood running clear
and clean. What you or the Empire needs, I’ve got, for a price.
(Core) Tradesmen are skilled labourers and craftsmen. Although they tend to cluster together
in cities, they can also be found in villages across the Empire. They provide many of the goods
used by Merchants when trading abroad, and are valued as an important part of the Empire’s
economy. Tradesmen include apothecaries, armourers, bowyers, brewers, calligraphers,
carpenters, cartographers, gem cutters, gunsmiths, herbalists, peddlers, shipwrights, smiths,
stoneworkers, tailors, and weaponsmiths. Each trade has its own guild, though not all
guilds have local chapters.

Trade Guilds Across the Empire
While rare, there are select trades that have “over-guilds” spanning
more than one Imperial village or province. Their primary guildhalls are
located in Altdorf, allowing them to negotiate deals directly with many
ambassadors and envoys. However, any affiliated tradesman’s business
carries the mark or seal of the group, and the most prosperous local
business in any community can act as a minor guildhall.
The Bowyers’ Fraternity: Formed originally solely by elven bowmakers,
humans dominate this guild now, though its long-time leader remains
the former elf envoy Grathol Fellicar. Bows from this over-guild are
more expensive than standard bows, but their craftsmanship and
durability is more reliable than non-Brotherhood bows.
The Trusted Brotherhood of Brewers: Within the Moot, Averland, and
Stirland, the “Trusties” are guilded brewers who share recipes, herbs,
and roots to guarantee that travelers can find tolerable brews wherever
their silver mug stamp may be found. Tavern keepers know that the
added costs of “trusted” ales and beers are recouped by increased traffic
and higher demand for their known-quality wares. The “Most Trusted”
(or guildmaster) is Udo Altankard, a dwarf as wide as he is tall, and
brewer extraordinaire.
The Puissant Fellowship of Skilled Cartographers: The five Kharllan
brothers built this guild 25 years ago, using their father’s shipping trade
to train scouts and cartographers. Their “guild homes” are in the five
largest cities of the Empire, and their craftsmanship is higher than most.
This over-guild guarantees the accuracy of its maps in terms of coastal
details and hazards from Kislev to the Black Gulf.
Susi Olfsdar
The widow of a halfling shipwright in Altdorf’s Reikport, Susi has
gained a local reputation as a wonder-worker with leather. Her small
tannery is on the outskirts of the city and downwind of most buildings
due to the smells. Despite the odour, the quality of her tanned leather
goods and Susi’s irrepressible nature bring many customers back.
With the surprising variety of dyed-leather goods, from cowls and
belt-purses to waterproofed leather cloaks or overtunics, “Olfsdar
buckskins” now compete with the best leather goods without added
guild costs, much to the fury and indigestion of Pieter Donaltun, the
local guildmaster of leather workers.
Adventure Seeds
Essential Errands: Numerous tradesmen in the party’s local settlement
desire help acquiring materials for their trades, yet cannot do these tasks
themselves for various reasons. The party can be dispatched to retrieve
deerskins for a tanner, find rare plants for the apothecary, herbalist, or
brewer, or hunt up beaver pelts for the furrier.
Wealth in the Rocks: Two local tradesmen – a gem cutter and stone
worker – hire the party to escort their agents to a small mining town
where the River Auden meets the Black Mountains. There, they receive
two shipments of stone and uncut gems and the party is expected to
escort them safely back to the tradesmen for their payments.

Troll Slayer
My shame is my own. Let me find an enemy worthy of it.
(Core) Dwarfs who have been disgraced, crossed in love, or otherwise humiliated abandon
traditional society and seek the sweet release of death. They hunt the most dangerous of
monsters in the hopes of finding a glorious end. Most of them die fairly quickly, but those few
who survive become members of the strange cult of Troll Slayers. They exist only to die, and
by doing so redeem whatever disgrace they suffered in the past. They seek the fiercest foes, and
Trolls are considered ideal because the Dwarfs’ deaths are almost a certainty. Troll Slayers are instantly
recognizable, with their spiky orange hair, outlandish tattoos, and gaudy jewellery. They spend a great
deal of time boasting of their exploits and show off their many scars, and often indulge in bouts of
overeating, drunkenness, and sleep deprivation.
Note: Only Dwarfs can join this career. Taking the Slayer’s path is a sure route to death. Think
carefully before entering this career.

A Troll Slayer’s Leather Jerkin
When slayers form regiments in dwarf armies, they are famed for
fighting bare-chested, showing their brethren that they will meet their
doom with gusto. So it can strike some people as remarkable that
Slayers are found wearing leather jerkins. Surely they wouldn’t seek to
protect themselves?
The fact is that leather jerkins are considered a practical comfort, rather
than serious protection (dwarfs consider nothing less than a heavy mail
coat to be serious protection). Only hard-wearing gear will survive the
wilderness wandering a slayer undertakes. The famous bared chest is
something of an affectation of the battlefield.
So it is not uncommon to see a troll slayer wearing a leather jerkin, and
no hypocrisy or cowardice should be inferred by the fact. Many slayers
arrive to fight, shed their travelling gear (jerkin and all) and charge in to
face their doom with torso bared.
Adventure Hook
Glorious Death Awaits: Last night the troll slayer was in his cups and
blustering about his kills – the ravaging goblin chief, the fiend beneath
the barrow, even the berserk ox-head giant in the forest deeps. A group
of men listened avidly and bought beers. They explained they were
adventuring, following rumours of a distant tomb filled with treasures.
They insisted many fell guardians protect the tomb, a test to challenge
even him. The drunken slayer swore to accompany the men on their
journey, and boasted that whilst he stood they need fear no danger. If
the threat proves less than challenging, the troll slayer may turn his angst
elsewhere.
The Spirit of the Slayer Oath
The player of a Troll Slayer should agree with the GM as to
what it was that shamed his character into taking the Slayer
Oath. Typical reasons include being cheated in love, showing
cowardice, oath-breaking, producing shoddy workmanship or
being unable to clear one’s name of a crime.
Do note that it is up to the individual concerned whether or
not they react to such a dishonour by taking the Slayer oath;
a Dwarf is not forced to become a Slayer simply because
the Thane’s daughter refused to requite his affections (for
example).
A Dwarf taking the Slayer Oath vows to meet death fighting
against an enemy of the Dwarf race. However, it is important
to understand that the oath is more about regaining honour
than committing suicide, and only a minority of Slayers
take the seemingly obvious route of disappearing into
Skaven warrens or Orc infested mountains. Such desperate
individuals leave nothing to posterity. This is why many
Slayers accompany adventuring parties, the lifestyle provides
ample opportunity to come across worthy foes, and leaves
witnesses to tell of the Slayer’s doom.
See the entries for Giant Slayer and Daemon Slayer for more
about Slayers.

Vagabond
Me? I’m no one of consequence. Just passing through….
(Core) Vagabonds love life on the road. The traditional Peasant or Burgher existence seems like prison
to them. Who wants to wake up in the same village or city every day, doing the same thing as yesterday?
Vagabonds are footloose wanderers who look on each day as a new adventure. They may take on odd jobs
here and there to earn some brass, but they never stay in one place for long. The road beckons, with the
promise of something better always over the next hill. While they do love to travel, they are not ignorant
of the dangers of the road. Vagabonds can thus often be found in travelling companies, formed for mutual
protection. The law has little love for these groups and in many places Vagabonds are viewed as common
criminals.

Werner Wintrich alias Markus the Cat
Werner is a man with a history. He is far more than the weather-worn
and penniless vagabond he appears to be. Formerly he was Markus the
Cat, one of the Empire’s most proficient cat burglars, and responsible
for no less than a dozen jewel thefts from the Imperial nobility. Now,
he has given up his life of crime to see the world and escape his past.
He has left behind any riches his former career might have brought and
taken to the road. Now all Werner wants is to be left alone and to see
what lies over the horizon for the rest of his days.
Alas, Werner will have to run quickly if he is to escape his previous
career. The dashing Markus the Cat was as much a stealer of hearts as
jewels. Jilted lovers and robbed nobles rarely forget their grudgesand he
still has a large bounty on his head. In particular, his last haul, where
he stole the jewelled necklace of the Countess Carola von Trappe, still
haunts him.
He gave the jewellery to his partner who was killed in a barroom
squabble that very night. All interested parties believe he still has the
necklace and so they hire bounty hunter after bounty hunter to find the
elusive Cat.
Vagabonds and the Ranger Tongue
Quite a few vagabonds have picked up on the enigmatic language of
the Woodsmen, the so-called Ranger Tongue. A hodgepodge of human
languages (particularly Reikspiel and Breton) and elvish, this secret
tongue is useful in two respects. First, it is a code language, useful for
passing messages even when unfriendly ears are listening.
For example, greeting someone with the elven word for ‘visitor’ while
raising the left hand tells the listener ‘those I travel with are not to be
trusted.’ Second, the language is rich in terminology describing the
dangers of the woods and the outdoors.
A complex situation, such as the wolves in a certain stretch of woods
starving and turning to hunting men, might only take a single word in
Ranger Tongue. In addition, a seasoned traveller knows that keeping on
the good side of the woodsmen is never a bad idea. Knowing Ranger
Tongue facilitates that.
Adventure Seeds
The Exchange: A vagabond wanders into the party’s camp and
exchanges a hot meal for the location of a strange ruin he found just a
few days ago while wandering through a particularly trackless part of
the Forest of Arden. Whether the vagabond speaks the truth or is setting
the party up for ambush is difficult to say. What lends veracity to his
story is a strange stone covered with bizarre iconography. He calls it a
‘key stone,’ though he is uncertain exactly what that means.
Common Purpose: A local sheriff seems to have a particular vendetta
against vagabonds in his jurisdiction. A small group of ragged travellers
have pooled what little money they possess to try to hire someone tough
and armed to teach this sheriff a lesson. They don’t want him killed –
they just want to be left alone.

Valet
Your dress uniform has been washed, pressed and is laid out for you. Is there anything else you need at the

(Core) A Valet is a personal manservant for a Nobleman, high-ranking military commander, or wealthy
Burgher. He is responsible for the comfort and appearance of his charge, including grooming, wardrobe,
and presentation. A Valet is ready with a hat and cloak when it’s raining, a walking stick for outdoor
jaunts, and a dress coat for formal occasions. A well-trained Valet is indispensable for the style-conscious
Noble. Though they enjoy a lifestyle most Servants would kill for, Valets often resent the vacuous
Nobles they are forced to attend. Women who perform these services for Noblewomen are known as
handmaidens.

The August League of Imperial Cupbearers
Situated in an old hilltop manor in the picturesque spa town of
Wurtbad, the August League of Imperial Cupbearers is a private club
with membership extending solely to the elite valets of the Old World.
The engagement of a League valet is a much desired status symbol
amongst the upper crust. League valets have served the most powerful
and influential Lords of the Empire since the ascent of Magnus the Pious
to the Imperial throne in 2304. While the League is not a labour guild,
and has no administrative function in the hiring or deployment of valets,
the Cupbearers’ exclusivity of membership has fostered a longstanding
reputation for superiority.
The Cupbearers are a self-perpetuating body with an application process
that guarantees no unproven valet may join. Two existing members in
good standing must first propose and second prospective Cupbearers.
Once the process is initiated, the candidate’s name is entered on a new
page of the Application Codex. Members who know and support the
prospective valet are encouraged to sign the page. Eleven members
must endorse the applicant before an election committee votes on his
membership. Only when a candidate surpasses this final barrier is he
admitted to the League and shown the Black Book.
Although a significant number of the Old World’s nobility consists of
empty-headed dilettantes and boorish clods, it is the valet’s duty to endure
the ignominy of his master’s questionable behaviour without complaint.
Therefore, the Black Book is a secret tome in which League valets can
record and share the shameful and embarrassing exploits of their masters
without reproach. Every Cupbearer is responsible for updating the Black
Book, so that future valets will know what debaucheries to expect from
prospective employers. Needless to say, the Black Book contains many
secrets that could shake the patrician ranks to their core.
The Adjutant
A valet in the service of an active military commander is known as an
adjutant. In peacetime, the roles of the adjutant and the valet are nearly
indistinguishable. But in times of war, the civilian valet steps aside to
allow the adjutant to follow his master headlong into battle.
Typically, the adjutant is an officer in the same military formation as his
commander. He plays the role of his lordship’s coachman when they are
on campaign, and is responsible for his master’s personal baggage train
and the organisation of his field quarters.
On the battlefield, the adjutant is sometimes employed as a messenger
when communications are muddled and subordinates absolutely need
to be sure of orders. But when sword meets shield, the adjutant’s place
is at his master’s side in the heart of battle, ready to turn aside any blows
meant for his lordship. Many adjutants form a lifelong bond with their
master and follow them into their post-military life as stewards.
Adventure Seeds
Conspiracy Theories: A well-liked noble is being investigated by an
overzealous witch hunter for heresy, and his valet is appealing to his
colleagues for help. Although the evidence is overwhelming, a stealthy
investigation of the noble’s court and staff may point to a conspiracy
from within.
The Rental Retinue: A young and spoiled lordling is looking to
impress the beautiful daughter of a local noble. His plan is to hire a
valet and the other requisite staff to form a “proper” war-party, and then
enter the local dark forest to slay some sort of beast.

A Day in the Life
A vampire hunter’s daily life is long hours of fear, hatred, and endurance
interrupted by episodes of mind-jarring terror and bloody carnage. As
the sun rises the hunter sets about his work, for he knows that only
during the day can he enjoy even the illusion of safety. Combining equal
measures of caution and haste, he must gather clues of his prey, telltale
signs all the undead leave in their wake. This can include tracking and
gathering gossip or hours of research and study on long dead families
and forgotten locals.
Then, if the day is not over, the hunter will try and corner his quarry
while it sleeps. More often, there will be days, weeks, or even years of
pursuit as vampires are a canny, intelligent, and illusive foe. This means
that at the end of each day, fearful of discovery, the hunter must find
a defensible place to hole up and wait with stake and hammer for the
dawn. Sleep is found only fleetingly for the vampire hunter, always by
day, and usually beneath the rays of the sun. This cycle continues until
the hunter is successful, or more likely, becomes the hunted.
The Hunter’s Curse
The profession of vampire hunter is not one many choose willingly.
They are often driven to it because of something that happened in their
life. Often this is revenge for someone slain by the vampire, though
there are occasionally other reasons.
Here are a couple of possible vampire hunter motivations, though they
are certainly not the only ones.
Lost Loved One: Perhaps the most common motivation is the loss
of a loved one to the bloodsuckers. The death of wives and daughters
especially can twist a man’s soul into a dark knot and convince him to
take up the hammer and stake.
Jealousy: A rare, though not unknown, motivation is jealousy. Some
who learn of the existence of vampires, and catch a glimpse of the
creature’s dark majesty, want it for themselves. So they turn to hunting
these horrors to learn their secrets.
Death Wish: For some, hunting vampires is a warped kind of suicide.
Though they might not admit it to themselves, they push themselves
harder and harder and try and tackle progressively more difficult foes in
their ultimate quest to die. Many hunters starting out on their journey
for other reasons, end up here.
Glory: It is not uncommon for some, particularly warriors, to view the
hunting of vampires as a measure of prowess, strength, and courage.
These crazed individuals delight in the chase and the inevitable life and
death struggle, proving themselves greater fighters that the lords of the
night.
Adventure Seeds
This Time It’s Too Personal: Erhart’s wife was turned on the same
bloody night he vowed to become a vampire hunter. Now, years later
he has tracked her down, but cannot bring himself to do the deed and
finish it. He needs someone with more steel in their blood to help him
kill his wife.
Enough is Enough: After a while, many vampire hunters loose their
faith and succumb to a death wish. This is the case with Klaus, and he
now seeks to end his endless struggle in the bloodiest fashion. Perhaps a
friendly ear can help him carry on, or aid him in his final blaze of glory
against the dark masters of the night.

Verenean Investigator
What have we here? Let me take a closer look. Hmm... Interesting. Very interesting.
(SH) Verenan Investigators are agents who look into matters the cult would rather not come to the regular
authorities, such as the roadwardens or the witch hunters. They are adept at quiet investigation, looking
for clues and observing the scene, rather than extracting possibly unreliable information through
torture. Though they usually turn their results over to the cult for further action, they are also ready to
take matters into their own hands, if need be.
Investigators often come from within the cult itself, although the Verenan hierarchy does not
scruple at hiring talented people with questionable pasts, so long as they repent their ways and
swear loyalty to the goddess. Verenan Investigators have a wide range of knowledge, and often
astound others with their ability to bring obscure information together to throw light on a case.

A Day in the Life
The security forces of the Old World provide an emergency service – the
watch are usually called to deal with immediate incidents of violence,
arson, or burglary. However, if the perpetrators aren’t still on the scene,
and there are no witnesses or obvious leads, the watch are unlikely
to pursue the matter. Only the very largest watch forces, such as the
Altdorf watch, employ specialised detectives.
The Cult of Verena is aware of this shortcoming. They train a group
of investigators and dispatch them to look into unsolved crimes or
intractable disputes. This could be something as lurid as a murderer at
large, or a heist of jewellery. The investigators might look into rumours
of a large scale fraud, or seek a resolution to a lasting feud between two
noble families.
Investigators search for evidence, talk to witnesses and suspects, and
even put together criminal profiles. They tend to work surreptitiously,
though, being members of the Verenean cult they will be loathe to lie
should they be quizzed about their activities). This is not due to wilful
secrecy as much as it is to the investigator knowing he is more likely to
find what he needs if he isn’t burdened with help from some ham-fisted
watchman or witch hunter.
Once the investigator has amassed all the evidence he can, he will make
a comprehensive report to his superiors, who will then decide how to
take the case further. His task complete, the investigator soon moves on
to his next case.
Affiliations
The Verenean investigators are, of course, well respected members of the
Cult of Verena, and have the ears of her priests and other devotees.
Their relationship to the forces of law and order is mixed. On one
hand, the investigators might find leads in cases that leave the
Watch flummoxed, and so provide a great service. On the other,
many watchmen are jealous of the skill and reputation of Verenean
investigators, or worried they might blow the whistle on bribe taking or
some other form of corruption the watch is indulging in.
Members of the Cult of Ranald and other criminals loathe Verenean
investigators, as they are often more perceptive and less receptive to
bribery than the watch. If a Verenean investigator is in the same town as
a prominent crime lord , the investigator may well find himself a target,
even if he isn’t currently looking into the crime lord’s activities.
Adventure Seeds
Guarded Words: A Verenean Investigator may clash with the
authorities in the Empire over some coverup they are keen to keep
secret, such as the existence of the skaven or the fact that the heir of
an important noble lord is actually a mutant. This might prove a very
tricky situation, as the Cult of Verena is dedicated to truth and justice,
but does not want to spark off a diplomatic incident.
Never Giving Up: An adventuring partyfinds out that a Verenean
investigator is on their tail after they have committed a larcenous
activity. The man’s persistence and professionalism outstrips that of the
watch, and the party might have to go back to destroy evidence and buy
the silence of witnesses if they want to escape justice.

rising up the ranks, eventually finds himself a Veteran. Veterans are, first and foremost, survivors. They don’t
volunteer for suicide missions and they don’t take unnecessary risks, but when the time comes to get stuck
in, they’re some of the toughest troops on the field. Off-duty Veterans are always good for old war tales. They
carouse with a will, knowing that their time may be short and there’s no sense in dying with gold still in
your pockets.

A Day In The Life
Veterans have three distinct lifestyles: at camp, at war and at rest.
At camp, the veteran is usually the taskmaster for the recruits and less
experienced soldiers – not an officer, but directly reporting to them.
He makes sure all the jobs are done, that weapons are maintained, the
horses cared for and orders followed. He drills the soldiers, and judges
and evaluates them, making sure everyone is fit for the tasks they’re
assigned. He also keeps his own skills sharp with constant drilling
among his fellow veterans. At night, he may relax with some drink or
gambling, but never to excess, not when the enemy might be near.
At war, the veteran fights. If he does his job well, those he fights
alongside will help keep him alive. He is a brutal combatant, showing
and expecting no mercy, but he does not waste time in battle with petty
cruelty. A clean, fast, kill and on to the next. If he’s tasked with holding
ground, he holds it until all hope is gone – but no longer. He’s a soldier,
not a martyr. If forced to retreat or surrender, he will do so in preference
to dying, but he will not drop his sword unless he is certain, based on
surviving many battles, that fighting on is just a messy way of slitting
his own throat.
At rest, the veteran sets aside his veneer of hard-bitten discipline. He
might have died yesterday; he may die tomorrow; today is for the joy of
being alive! He will take what he has earned and indulge in every drink
and debauchery imaginable. A rare few veterans will use “quiet time” to
hone the arts of war, finding skilled partners to duel with or even taking
work training a local militia, but most indulge until they are broke, then
seek out the next battle.
Otto the Ox
While still a lad of fourteen, Otto Groensberk happened to befriended
some mercenaries who had momentarily come to town to drink and
whore. Otto ended up marching out with them, seduced to a life of
drinking, wenching and glorious battle.
The first battle saw all but Otto slain. Otto managed to impress the
commander of the opposing forces, and found a place with them.
Surprisingly strong for his youth, he became stronger with each passing
year, earning the title “the Ox”. He also moved a lot between mercenary
bands. Each battle lost, he learned some new tricks and tactics. He
never turned coats during a fight – that is death to a mercenary – but if
the fight was lost and prisoners were being taken, he learned the knack
of convincing the victor that he belonged with them. He often replaced
men he had personally slain, arguing that the fact he was standing and
they were not was proof he could do their job better.
Over time, his reputation became a liability. Despite being a great
fighter and a fairly good companion, he became known as a curse – to
be assigned to fight alongside the Ox was to die while he lived. No one
ever accused him of cowardice, shirking his duty or treason – he just
had a knack for staying alive that others did not share.
Adventure Seeds
Family Affairs: One of the characters encounters a grizzled veteran
and, during conversation, discovers to his amazement that the old
survivor is a distant blood relative. The veteran announces that he has
discovered a cache of great wealth during his travels, and needs the help
of someone he can trust – his own flesh and blood – to retrieve it from
the orc-infested caves where it lies.

Village Elder
We don’t get many outsiders here; what brings you to these parts?
(KotG) Bretonnian nobles are responsible for bringing justice to the peasants. If they hear of a crime,
they make sure that someone is punished. As long as it’s a peasant, they do not worry about which
peasant. In some cases, the lord has hanged the victim. Most peasants would prefer to avoid such
“justice.”
Instead, they turn to their Village Elders, respected residents of the village. These old men
listen to the details of the case and then hand out punishments. Often these involve
paying reparations to the victim, normally in labour, but sometimes the Village Elders
arrange “accidents” for the criminal.
The quality of this justice depends entirely on the quality of the Village Elder, as there are
no checks on his decisions. A senile elder is still capable of handing down something less
than justice. However, it is still almost invariably better than appealing to the local lord.

A Day in the Life
It is not uncommon for village elders to be more or less retired within
their community. A craftsman in his youth may lack the eyesight or deft
hands to continue working at his trade, while the rigours of manual
labour would take too great a toll on their ageing bodies. Much of
their life is spent simply waiting until they are asked to lend wisdom
to a communal matter, so village elders often find themselves with an
overabundance of time.
More assertive village elders take it upon themselves to lend wisdom
to the community whether they ask for it or not. These elders walk the
village, chastising impertinent youths, warning children to play safely,
shaking their walking sticks vigourously at layabouts, and offering
advice on any topic that interests them to anyone who will listen.
But their lives are also filled with mundane matters – gathering wood,
tending hearth fires, and cooking are other tasks that may fall to the
village elder. Many villagers are happy to have such a wise person in
their midst, and do what they can to assist the elder’s family. Bringing
over the occasional pie or pot of soup, helping to mend a wall or fence,
or delivering a load of cut firewood in the early spring and late autumn
are all typical gestures of gratitude.
Respect Your Elders
You don’t become a village elder without having lived a long life, at
least, longer than the others in your village who would otherwise vie for
the position. Most village elders are fiercely proud of their station, and
are quick to point out how the vast experiences learned over their lives
benefit the village.
And the younger folk had best take heed of such experience, lest they
find their ears pulled, heads slapped or otherwise earn their elder’s
wrath. Which is all well and good, as this ensures that those youths will
likewise enforce their ideals and wisdom with a clout to the head when
they rise to the rank of village elder.
Adventure Seeds
The Mythical Cave of Lacrimac: The adventurers arrive at the
village of Pont du Boue in Gisoreux, drawn by tales of a nearby cave
said to contain the hidden treasures of the Thirteen Sleeping Knights
of Lacrimac. The only villager who claims to know the location of
the mythical cave is Zacharie Vieillard, a decrepit village elder. He
is unimpressed by the youth of today, and will only reveal the cave’s
location if the adventurers can prove to him that they are responsible
and up to the challenge by completing the various, increasingly bizarre
tasks he demands they perform.
A Transplanted Leader: A strange plague has wiped out the elders of
the village of Crasseville in Parravon. The survivors are all children, the
oldest no more than seventeen. As such, the villagers are at a loss how
to run their own affairs. Quelle fortune! The adventurers pass by the
settlement and the villagers have an idea. They promise a great reward
if the adventurers will steal for them a new elder from the village of Le
Moisi, across the river. The inhabitants of Le Moisi will not be inclined
to part with any of their own villagers.

Wall Warden
Finished? I’ll have you defending this bit of wall when the Beastmen come... There are a few things you want to
check again, are there? Well, well.
(KotG) Wall Wardens are the peasant craftsmen who care for and design the fortifications of
Bretonnian nobles, the massive castles that protect their power. They are also responsible for
the construction and care of siege engines. Most nobles know nothing about building or
engineering and thus need to place a great deal of trust in their Wall Wardens. As a result,
a peasant is only given such a post after proving himself.
As Wall Wardens often have both the ear and the trust of their lords, such a post is often
a stepping stone to a more important position in the lord’s administration. On the other
hand, Wall Wardens are sometimes approached by outside forces to report on the state of
the lord’s defences. The loyal ones naturally refuse.

Affiliations
Wall wardens are supposed to be loyal only to the noble who employs
them, and traitors are quite rare. Most wall wardens feel protective of
“their” noble, and their pride in their fortifications stops them from
deliberately setting their masters up to fall. Thus, they rarely make deals
with other members of the nobility.
They do make deals with other wall wardens. A wall warden has
responsibility without power, and while nobles see him as a peasant,
peasants see him as an oppressor. Thus, wall wardens can only really
complain to other wall wardens, and informal contacts long ago
developed into formal, but secret, organisations linking the masons of
Bretonnia.
There are several of these groups, and most claim to include all true
masons and have a tradition stretching back to the days of Gilles le
Breton. Members are initiated in clandestine ceremonies emphasising
the need for secrecy as firm as castle walls, and they identify each other
with secret handshakes.
Most of the groups are harmless, providing wall wardens with
somewhere to complain about their jobs and lords without risking their
necks or their lord’s security. Others, however, are gathering information
on defences across the country, perhaps for the benefit of a particular
lord or for the coming peasant revolt. There is even one that is a front
for the Ruinous Powers, although most members do not realise that
until it is too late.
Very occasionally, a member of one group is approached to join another.
Since most of the groups claim to be unique, this comes as a surprise,
and most wall wardens are very suspicious of this second group.
Little Known Facts
Wall wardens normally have effective command of the fortifications
when a castle comes under siege. The troops guarding the wall
understand the wardens know what they are doing, and often distrust
the lord’s judgement. Of course, the lord is never allowed to realise that
his orders are being ignored, and in the chaos of battle this is easier than
one might think.
Adventure Seeds
Unnerving Discovery: While repairing a wall, the wall warden
uncovers a hidden passage, blocked up years ago. It leads to a temple
dedicated to the Ruinous Powers, with further passages diving deeper
into the earth. If the existence of the temple becomes known, the lord
will be executed as a servant of Chaos, along with all the peasants
working at his castle, including the wall warden. Thus, the wall warden
must deal with the problem, and find out whether the lord actually is a
servant of Chaos, without drawing any attention.
New Management: The lord’s son insists on interfering in the
maintenance of the castle, giving orders and “supervising” the work. The
lord sees this as a good thing, as his son taking an interest in the castle
he will one day inherit. The wall warden, however, can see that the son’s
orders are weakening the fortifications. Indeed, after a time he comes
to suspect that this must be deliberate. What could the son and heir
possibly be doing?

Warleader
The third eye? Got that many years back. Oh, the fourth eye? Yeah, that one’s new.
(ToC) Warleaders are proven Norsemen warriors who’ve seen countless battles and are
entrusted by their Jarls and Kings to lead detachments of other warriors and Marauders
against their enemies. Typically, Warleaders bear many strange tattoos, ritual scars, and
most, if not all, have one or more mutations, showing they have the favour of the Gods.

† Chaos Warrior is described in Chapter XIII: Slaves to Darkness of Tome of Corruption.
A Day in the Life
To lead those sworn to Chaos is never easy; to lead Norseman sworn
to Chaos takes a brutal ferocity and savage charisma that is almost
impossible to describe. A warleader must take a band of savage, insane
murderers and point them all in the same direction, even sometimes
forcing them to follow a plan more complicated than “If it moves, hit it
until it stops moving.”
A warleader begins his day with rites rededicating himself to the gods of
Chaos, before surveying his warband. He will make sure that everything
is ready for the day’s activities, which will generally be a) marching to
a place of slaughter, and/or b) slaughtering. He will also have to deal
with any challengers to his position. While some will try (and fail) to
kill him in his sleep, most would-be warleaders prefer to fight in the
open, to show all of their soon-to-be followers their prowess. If a week
goes by without a serious challenge, the warleader might begin to fear
something is wrong; if his followers are too complacent and willing to
obey, they are not truly infused with the power of Chaos!
If it is a good day, there will be battle – a village to overrun, or a
wilderness fortress to seize and burn. Blood will flow – that of the foe,
that of his own band, it’s all good – and if the warleader is victorious, he
has brought glory to the ruinous powers. If he is fortunate, the gods will
grant him with a mark of their favour – a new mutation of his body; a
living badge of the Chaos gods’ pleasure.
Little Known Facts
Warleaders take great pride in their scars, tattoos and, especially,
mutations. When two warleaders meet, unless it is in direct battle, they
will spend some time comparing these things, bragging about how
they acquired them, and so on. To have identical or similar patterns to
another warleader is a great insult, and violence will inevitably erupt.
In the course of their pillaging, warleaders leave behind tragic reminders
of their passing in the form of children born to the women they
ravished, who come into the world tainted with the blood of Chaos.
Many of these are killed by their parents or by witch hunters, but a few
manage to grow to adulthood.
Most heed the call of Chaos and flee to the lawless wastes or forests,
or seek out secret cults to join, but a rare few defy their heritage and
become great crusaders, hiding their deformities and masking the shame
of their bloodline by persecuting the worshippers of the Dark Gods.
Adventure Seeds
The Old Hand: A mercenary company is in town, boozing and doing

on his back, hidden beneath a heavy cloak. This is Snorri Heart-Eater, a
feared warleader of Khorne, apparently now working as a veteran on the
fringes of the Empire. Has Chaos infested the military ranks, or does it
start and end with Snorri Heart-Eater? Will the characters turn him in
or try to defeat Snorri and rid the Empire of another mutant?
Ascension: There is great excitement in the Chaos Wastes, and word of
it has spread to Kislev and the northernmost provinces of the Empire.
A feared warleader, Jarn of the Nine Scars, has been elevated to a
champion of Chaos and plans to lead an unholy crusade, a band of
bands, into the south. The characters are despatched to assassinate the
champion of Chaos before his horde gathers strength.

Warlock
The Hartshorn Lodge
The liberal view of Marienburgers towards the use of magic has turned
the city into a refuge for those wishing to practice their aethyric talents
without the constraints of Imperial law. It is a natural byproduct that
some of these free-thinking dabblers come across Chaos and Dark
Magic in their studies.
Unfortunately, Marienburgers share the same view on the Dark Lores
as their narrow-minded Imperial cousins, and allow witch hunters
to operate unfettered in the city. As a consequence, the sophisticated
Marienburg warlock requires a place where he can safely study “the
alternative lores” without risking meddlesome interference from the
authorities. Such a haven can be found along a stretch of isolated coast,
several leagues northeast of Marienburg.
On the surface, the Hartshorn Lodge functions as a hunting and fishing
retreat for the Marienburg gentry. The extensive lower dungeons and
massive occult library suggest other activities, however. The Hartshorn
Lodge is a place where the urbane warlock can study the Dark Lores
in peace and share discoveries with like-minded fellows. As a service to
its members, the lodge also employs a team of grave-robbers to keep its
pantry stocked year round.
The Warlock Perspective
On True Magic: The great lie must be revealed. The Archmage
Teclis has duped men into believing that true magic is beyond their
understanding. The founding of the Eight Colleges ensures the
Imperials practice a fragmented form of magic, while the devious elves
withhold the real secrets to power. The vilification of the Dark Lores is
yet another deception intended to curtail man’s knowledge of the aethyr,
by exploiting irrational fears of daemons and necromancy. The warlock
rejects these deceptions, and embraces Chaos lore and Dark Magic as
essential components to controlling aethyr.
On Dark Magic: Although the tedious witch hunters constantly
lecture that the slightest exposure to Dark Magic is highly corruptive,
this is another gross exaggeration intended to spread fear and
misinformation. Dark Magic, or Dhar, is simply the stagnation of
aethyric energy. As such, a proficient warlock can manipulate and
control it in the same way that the blacksmith manipulates fire.
On Necromancy: It is a simple matter for the elves to condemn
necromancy, since they often live for hundreds of years or more. Why
should mankind be condemned to a fraction of that time when there
exists an opportunity to extend life? The ancient Lahmians venerated
necromancy and they were among the most advanced civilisations of
their time. The creation of undead minions is a situation borne out of
necessity, when one is hunted across every acre of his homeland.
On Daemonology: The warlock’s trade with daemonkind is perhaps
the truest example of his even-handed approach to the study of the
aethyr. For what better specimen to learn from than a denizen of the
aethyr itself! The summoning of daemons is a perilous business, but
minor daemons are quite limited mentally and easy to control. Greater
daemons can be a bit trickier to deal with, and it is imperative to
establish dominance early.
Adventure Seeds
The Price of Power: A Strigoi vampire is willing to trade the ancient
secrets of Blood Magic for assistance on a dangerous river journey. A
vampire hunter, as well as a pair of Lahmian agents, are in close pursuit.
Warlock
Do not dare to call upon the great dark powers, unless you are willing to risk everything –
even your soul – as I have.
(RoS) Witches that use Dark Magic and embrace its power can become Warlocks if they
survive its perils long enough to gain the required knowledge. They may not realize it
at first, but this is a dangerous path that leads almost inevitably to corruption. They are
the bogeymen of the witch hunters, the spellcasters that are a danger to themselves and to
others. Warlocks tend to be either Daemonologists or Necromancers. Since they are selftaught
and so much of their magic is based on experimentation, however, most Warlocks
have unique views of magic and the world. It is this individuality that makes it so hard for
the witch hunters to root them out.
Note: You must have at least one insanity point and learned at least two spells through
your Witchcraft talent before you can enter this career.

Warrior Priest
The Hammer of Sigmar
Johann made his way into the drear catacombs. This wasn’t like fighting
the Brets. This was different, confusing. And now they were down a
hole in the ground looking to fight the dead. Surely the dead had had
enough of fighting. Still, he was glad that the priest was there. He didn’t
say much, but just his presence was enough to make Johann feel better.
Johann thought back to the priest in his home village. Not sure he’d be
up to much in a place like this when battle was joined. Baldy, on the
other hand, certainly knows how to handle himself in a fight. He was a
true warrior, as well as being a priest. Well-named, no doubt.
Suddenly a hand erupted from the earthy wall, followed by a skull
and the rest of a skeletal body bedecked in ancient armour. It swung a
rusted blade, and caught Johann on the side of his helmet. Johann fell
to the ground, more dazed than damaged. He recovered only quickly
enough to see the skeletal abomination raise its weapon once more for
the killing blow.
Then just as suddenly, flames shot through the air and burst over the
dead warrior, sending the bones to their final rest, a charred pile on the
tunnel floor. Johann looked back to see the priest close behind with his
arm raised. The power of Sigmar shining in his eyes.
‘Thank you,’ Johann said weekly. ‘I didn’t know you could do that.’
‘Sigmar is not just the Hammer. He is the Word,’ the priest said dryly.
Before he could reply, another skeleton came to life and advanced on
Johann. But as it moved to strike, the priest bounded forward and
smashed his hammer through the creature’s skull, sending fragments
flying. The rest of its body fell limply to the ground.
‘Sigmar is not just the Word,’ said the priest, walking past Johann and
on down the dark tunnel.
Myrmidian Battle Prayer
Our mother of battle, she who keeps our blades keen, who keeps our shields
ready, and our armour strong, grant us the grace to know our enemies, and
the honour to stand against them, and the strength to defeat them.
This we pray in Myrmidia’s name.

Miscommunication: The temple is approached by a representative of
a nearby village. The village is being visited by many strange unliving
beings in the dead of night, that are carrying off innocent villagers. The
representative asks for many warriors and many priests to be sent to deal
with the dire threat. However, the dottering old High Priest is hard of
hearing, and thinks all these need for aid is a single warrior priest.
Infiltrating the Faith: A distant temple, in a secluded mountain pass,
has been causing concern for the High Priest for some time. Rumours
are filtering back that the entire fortress is being perverted by a nefarious
influence. The templars there are falling from the way and neglecting
the true path. A warrior priest must be sent, following the cult’s
tradition, as a seemingly new recruit to the temple. It will be his job to
spot any signs of decadence among the templars and report back to the
High Priest in coded missives.
Warrior Priest
Faith shall be my shield, and Sigmar my righteous hammer.
(ToS) Whilst all priests are expected to bear arms in the defence of
their temple and faith, and most are at least proficient in combat,
only a few march to battle alongside their templars and the Imperial
army. These warrior priests have a threefold responsibility: ministering to
the faithful amongst the army, offering spiritual and tactical advice to the army’s
leadership, and smiting the unfaithful in battle. When war comes to the temple, a cult’s
warrior priests take charge of its defence, marshalling the rest of the cult to repel attackers.
Warrior priests are usually members of holy orders, such as the Sigmarites of the Order of the
Silver Hammer. Most warrior priests come from the cults of Sigmar, Ulric, and Myrmidia,
although other cults are not without a few token militant brethren.

Watchman
Halt! Who goes there?
(Core) Originally, cities and towns were responsible for recruiting and maintaining their own watch organisations.
Corruption was so widespread that the Emperor gave the job to the army instead. Now, certain regiments on
garrison duty must serve as the town watch. This has cut down dramatically on corruption, though the army
itself is not immune. Watchmen are responsible for maintaining law and order and are empowered to make
arrests. They also double as fire fighters in smaller towns. For some Soldiers, watch duty is a temporary
assignment. For others, it becomes a lifelong career.

A Day in the Life
A watchman’s duties depend on where he works and lives. Small
settlements only employ a few guards, who are expected to answer an
alarm at any time. Meanwhile, in cities an organised force works in
shifts and patrols the streets in groups. In Middenheim, for example,
watchmen work ten hours a day, one week on daytime patrols
followed by a week on nights. Alternate Festags are days off (with the
consequence that criminal activity tends to spike on Festags).
Should watchmen see a crime in progress, or spot a criminal at large,
they will give chase. If the criminal is apprehended they will decide on
the punishment.
Watchmen of larger towns and cities in the Empire are technically part
of the armed forces. They train regularly in combat techniques and may
consult priests from the cults of Sigmar, Ulric, Myrmidia, and Verena
on how best to defend themselves whilst dispensing justice. They will
also be instructed in what to do in cases of emergency, such as fires or
coach crashes.
Methods of Punishment
When a criminal is caught the Watchman makes a decision on how to
proceed. In areas where crime is endemic many Watchmen see it as a
practical expedience to administer punitive beatings for petty crimes.
Spot fines may be charged for minor offences. The proceeds from
such fines are meant to be added to the town’s treasury, but often end
up supplementing Watchmen’s wages. Offenders may also be placed
in a pillory, were local people are invited to subject them to abusive
humiliations and overripe vegetables.
In cases of serious crimes the suspects are taken to the local watch house
and imprisoned there until an official such as a travelling judge or
member of the Cult of Verena can take a look at the case. It is not the
job of the watch to decide on whether serious criminals should be fined,
sent to gaol, banished, or executed – though they will be consulted
about evidence they might have.
Adventure Seeds
Stop the Killings: The most infamous of Old World criminals are the
pattern murderers. These disturbed individuals are driven to kill on a
regular basis, often using a distinctive technique or choosing a certain
sort of victim. When one of these killers is at large, public criticism of
the watch can reach boiling point, and the men of the Watch are put
under great pressure by their superiors to catch the murderer or come
up with a convincing scapegoat.
All In a Day’s Work: Sergeant Esker has been informed of a coach
crash. One passenger is a Wissenland noblewoman who supposedly
died last Sigmarzeit (netting her heirs a massive inheritance); another
is Gunter Gugenheimer, wanted in regard to a stolen idol. This must
be investigated before his men can get back to their public relations
work (instigated after a watchman called Altdorf’s dockers “Wierdrootlicking
crooks” and “worse than Marienburgers”). In the lobby a Priest
of Verena complains how unfair it is that the Watch employ no women
or Halflings, and a softly-spoken Tilean mentions “a mutually beneficial
business arrangement”. As the Sergeant brushes them off a local

Whaler
You killed a skaven, you say? A rat the size of a man? Come brag at us when ye’ve tackled a Chaos Beast
larger than two taverns that drags you a country’s width across the seas before it realizes you killed it!
(ToC) Whaling is an important trade for Norsca, and Whalers are respected even among the
warriors. Swimming through the dark currents of the Sea of Chaos are massive whales, many
of which bear strange markings, and odd colouration, twisted and warped as they are by
the power of Chaos. These monsters can capsize ships and swallow hundreds of men in a
single gulp. Thus, Whalers must be made of sterner stuff than ordinary fishermen.

Thar She Blows!
Whales provide not only meat but also blubber which can be processed
into oil for fuel. Not an ounce of a whale is wasted: the skin is used to
manufacture rope, the gullet to make shoes, and the stomach used as
floats. Even the lungs and intestines are eaten. Demand from Imperial
cities for whale oil to fuel street lamps has made whaling a very profitable
venture.
 The easiest way to hunt these creatures is for whalers to embark in
rowing boats and herd schools of small whales ashore where they can
easily slaughter them. However, there is no honour in such methods, and
Norsemen prefer the thrill of setting sail in a longship to chase the giant
whales that plough the ocean. Many young men join such expeditions; it
is the custom in many settlements that a girl should spurn a suitor who
has not killed his first whale. A captain is careful to vet his crew, due to
the belief that whales will attack boats crewed by dishonourable men.
Norsemen relish the danger of hunting these monsters. When a whale is
sighted, the rowers speed their vessel towards it. Harpooners gather at the
prow and, when in range, hurl their weapons at their quarry. The bravest
men leap from the boat onto the whale’s back, thrusting their spears deep
into its flesh before swimming back to their vessel.
A skewered whale can easily capsize a longboat, or tow the vessel by the
harpoon lines until it shudders apart. Its tail can sweep a man overboard,
where he will be swallowed whole in its maw. Few ships return home
with a full crew. The harpooners must ensure a swift kill – the best can
pierce a whale’s heart with a single throw. If this is impossible, whalers
aim to embed their harpoons in the monster’s ribs, enabling the crew to
drag it to the ship’s side where they can kill it with hooks and skewers.
A whaling vessel will not return to shore unless it is towing a slaughtered
whale. Whalers prefer a watery grave to the dishonour of returning
empty-handed. When a whaling ship does return after a successful hunt,
the gods are praised and celebrations continue for many days, for the
survival of the settlement is ensured for the next few months.
Scrimshaw
Although the Norse sagas romanticise whaling expeditions, much of
a whaler’s time is spent waiting until a quarry is spotted. Many spend
the long hours whittling whalebone or teeth. Their work involves
complex interlocking patterns, sinuous shapes, and heroes and animals
of legend. Soot is rubbed into the etching to bring it to view. This
method of engraving is known as scrimshaw, and those who practise it
are known as scrimshanders. Most whalers wear a scrimshaw necklace or
earring, as they believe that these talismans bring good luck. Some even
have scrimshaw designs tattooed on their flesh. Their profession is a
dangerous one and any form of protection is not to be scoffed at.

Winged Lancer
For the Queen, for Kislev, for glory -- we fly! And damned be he that first cries hold!
(RotIQ) Every Gospodar settlement annually raises a rota of winged lancers. Each
spring, eager young men muster alongside veterans and don armour at their rotamaster’s
command. To the sound of weeping womenfolk, they ride, their winged banners fluttering
behind them. Until their return, they are known as the “Riders of the Dead,” for they are mourned as
if already deceased. Every rota of lancers has a different character. Where some southern examples are like
Imperial knights, sporting colourful pennants, intricately decorated armour, and great animal pelts, lancers
from beyond the Lynsk are more akin to Ungol nomads, having heavy moustaches, top-knots, and fur-lined
charms to ward against evil.

Slaying the Eagle – Initiation Rites of the
Winged Lancers
The royal houses of Kislev have held the eagle to be a sacred bird for
time immemorial, and this is commemorated in a secret ritual that
every would-be winged lancer must complete. Armed only with a
bow, five arrows and a knife, the young man leaves his settlement and
ventures into the wild. His mission is clear – he must return within five
days with an eagle that he has slain. The eagle’s feathers will be used to
decorate his distinctive back banner and will mark him as worthy to
ride with the winged lancers
This is the tradition. Alas, that in many Gospodar communities it is
more practiced in the breach. Some richer families hire professional
hunters to accompany their sons into the wild. The youngster must still
take the shot himself, but he is aided by the hunters, who are expert
in the location of nearby nests. While not technically a violation of
tradition, grizzled veterans derisively call such practices “cheating the
eagle”. Rumours circulate that some noble sons even let the hunters take
the shot, plunging an arrowhead into the eagle’s corpse only after the
veteran huntsmen have brought it down. If such an allegation were ever
proved, the winged lancer in question would be drummed out of his
rota in disgrace.
Maxim Zakharov the Gryphon Slayer
Maxim is a young man but already his career has been distinguished.
When it was his time to slay the eagle, he brought back a dead griffon
instead, towing it behind a wild horse he had tamed. As a result,
his back banner is particularly impressive. Since then he has risen
quickly within his rota, proving his valour again and again. He has an
instinctive mastery of his horse and a fearless natureHe and his men are
the bane of Kurgan raiding parties from the Chaos wastes, and he has
personally slain a menacing ice troll that was terrorising isolated villages.
He has become a true hero of the people and his reputation is spreading
quickly.
However, there is a dark side to Maxim. He is troubled by strange
dreams, and has a fiery temper which sometimes gets the better of him.
He has gained a new friend lately, a grizzled, hobbled mentor scarred
from countless battles and missing his entire left arm. This friend, the
mysterious Gregori, is actually a minor daemon sent by the ruinous
power, Khorne, to win the young Maxim over to his service. The
daemon knows that if somehow Maxim could be seduced by the joys of
carnage and slaughter, he will rise to become a great champion for the
Blood God.

sight” are interviewed in these tents to determine their suitability to join the wise women, an experience
that can terrify even the strong of mind.

Mother Ursk
Mother Ursk is a character often spoken of in the tales and stories of the
Ungol. It is said in some stories that her Sight was so powerful that she
could sense the taint of Chaos in someone just by hearing their name.
She was also reputed to have been able not only to detect the Sight in
young girls but even awaken it by knocking them on the head.
One infamous custom she is reputed to have started is the practise of
kissing someone accused of a crime to try and taste the lies on their lips.
Of course should they shy away from the hag’s hairy wrinkled face then
surely they must have something to hide. Even today among the Ungol
this is known as Mother Ursk’s Kiss and greatly feared by both the guilty
and the innocent alike.
Rituals of Wise Women
Wise women are pillars of their Ungol communities, holding together
their people with sage advice and stern looks. With the aid of hags, wise
women also perform ancient Kislevite rituals to appease the spirits and
guide people through their lives. Two such rituals include the Becoming
and the Mark.
The Becoming: This is a highly secretive ritual where a young girl
suspected of having the Sight is tested. The girl is whisked away from
her home by a wise woman, with no chance to bid her parents goodbye,
and taken to a remote cave or tent somewhere in the oblast.
There her captor will subject the girl to tests of physical, mental and
magical endurance to see if she is strong enough to be initiated as a wise
woman herself. Those who fail and survive are returned to their family,
though they are never quite the same again.
The Mark: Wise women are known to place marks, curses, or the evil
eye on those who have crossed them or worked against their tribe. This
ritual begins with the setting of the sun and requires the presence of at
least one person who was wronged by the marked one.
The wronged persons will then list their grievances, sometimes long
into the night, whereupon the wise women will chant the marked one’s
name and call down their curse upon them. No one knows exactly
how the curse works, but it is no coincidence that the marked ones
experience extremely bad luck in short order.
Adventure Seeds
Spiritual Judgment: A local girl has exhibited extraordinary ability
during her Becoming ritual, so much so that the local wise women fear
she might possess more than just the Sight. To be sure, they decide to
send the girl to the north with a brave young wise woman where she
will be judged by the ancient spirits of the oblast at a secret location.
The Spirits are Stirring: For some reason the spirits of the remote
village of Torgrad have been angered and the local wise women are
powerless to placate them. Someone must journey to the dark place
where the river meets the hills to learn the true source of the spirits’
displeasure, and remedy it if they can.

Witch
The Dark Art
When country folk want a lost goat scried for or a wound healed with a
touch, they cautiously turn to a hedge wizard for help. However, when
someone wants to fulfil a petty act of vengeance against an enemy,
they visit a witch. Witches usually live in seclusion, for their presence
is unsettling to normal folk. Although few live up to reputation of old
Bloody Bones, a mythical hell-hag used by parents throughout the
Empire to scare children into behaving, most bear the marks of their
undisciplined use of magic – disfigurement and eccentricity. It takes a
brave soul to trek to the isolated cottage of a witch. For a few pennies,
the witch will work her magic for the petitioner; sometimes she will use
her art to heal, but usually it will be to curse an enemy or ruin a rival.
For some witches, the power to cause fear and harm becomes an
intoxicant, and they will begin to abuse their gift, and tyrannise their
neighbours for personal gain. Such blatant misuse of dark magic
sometimes attracts warlocks, who recruit witches to help them perform
unspeakable rituals. A warlock will organise his minions into a coven,
fashioning their erratic art into a tool of evil. There is no hope for
witches who are beguiled in this way; although the most talented
members of a coven might be favoured with the secrets of the warlock’s
power, all ultimately face either the damnation of their souls or the
flickering pyres of the witch hunters.
Gammer Moonsight
Gammer Moonsight’s tumbledown cottage in the hills of Stirhügel is
a beacon for those who seek miracle cures or want an enemy cursed.
Fashionable gentleladies arrive in disguise from distant Altdorf to buy
tinctures from this blind, half-deaf old woman, to bewitch their beaus
or curse rivals. It is rumoured that the Gammer was once visited by
an admiral of the Emperor’s navy, who purchased a pouch of wind to
scatter an invading Norse fleet.
Luckily for the Gammer, her reputation has yet to reach the ears of
priests and witch-hunters; events in this backward province are of little
interest to those beyond its borders. However, the longer the authorities
remain ignorant of her powers, the more dangerous the old woman will
become.
Gammer Moonsight, through no evil intent of her own, manifests dark
magic whenever she carries out the desires of her clients, the majority
of whom, selfish and spiteful, want her to harm rather than heal. Her
use of petty curses has attracted an imp of Slaanesh, that has begun to
worm its way into her soul. Eventually, she will be consumed by the evil
demands of her petitioners, and her body will become a vessel for this
vile daemon, imperiling everyone she comes into contact with.

The Good Doctor: A philanthropic physician moves to the provinces,
to improve the health of the peasants. To his frustration, modern
medicine competes with old beliefs: the rustics prefer the remedies of
wise women. The doctor embarks on a crusade to eradicate the witches.

A Crime of Passion: A young witch has been seduced by a noble who,
greedy for inheritance, manipulates her into using her powers to kill his
father. The noble then abandons the girl, letting her face the pyre for
the crime he inspired. The adventurers become embroiled in the affair,
untangling the truth to discover the real culprit.
Witch
Eye of newt? No, no, Lilith! Eye of dog! Dog! No wonder it’s frothing blue!
(RoS) Witches are Hedge Wizards who survived practicing their fumbling arts without
going completely insane or dying. They have a broader repertoire of homegrown spells
to work with and many dabble in areas best left alone. In other words, by merit of
their ignorance as to the occult workings of the Winds of Magic, many Witches begin
to use Dark Magic without even realising it. As a result of trial and error, Witches’
spells are more diverse and more powerful than the petty spells of other Hedge
Wizards, possessing elements of many of the Winds of Magic. However, Witches that
use the power of Dark Magic inevitably take a terrible toll upon their minds and souls.

Witch Hunter

(Core) Witch Hunters are grim individuals who have dedicated their lives to eradicating the forces
of Chaos, either in the service of the state or the Church of Sigmar. They prefer to seek out Chaos
cultists, Mutants, and heretics that have insidiously hidden amidst the cities of the Empire.
However, they will travel far indeed if they think they can strike a meaningful blow against
the forces of evil. Witch Hunters tend to be a surly and suspicious lot with no qualms about
killing innocents, so long as they also manage to slay the guilty, which means their appearance
is often regarded with dread by other folk.

The Witch-Finder General
A trained and sanctioned witch hunter may carry a writ that bears the
seal of the Witch-Finder General. The role of Witch-Finder General is
the highest attainable office within the practices of legally authorised and
sanctioned witch hunters operating openly in the Empire. Bearing such a
writ gives a witch hunter leave to investigate the taint of Chaos anywhere
within the Empire and act upon it should he find it.
By the wording of the writ, such a witch hunter answers only to the
Witch-Finder General, who in turn answers only to the Emperor. In
practise, of course, he must still abide by local authority, and local
nobles and law enforcers can still question his methods and decisions –
though they usually do so very cautiously. The real restraint governing a
sanctioned witch hunter, however, is the order itself. And few criminals
are dealt with as harshly as a rogue witch hunter.
The history of the office of Witch-Finder General is shrouded in mystery.
There is no official doctrine or evidence that such an office even exists –
no mention of any people who have held the position, no information on
where the Witch-Finder General is stationed, and no proof as to whether
or not the role is officially recognised by the Emperor. However, most
people are ignorant of these inconsistencies, or are too fearful of the wrath
of a witch hunter to demand proof of the authenticity of a writ sealed by
the Witch-Finder General.
The Mark of the Witch
Witch hunters use many different methods for determining whether a
suspect is guilty of being a witch. Each witch hunter tends to develop
their own methods, but a two have become common practise and have
gained infamy throughout the Empire – ducking and branding.
Ducking – Witch hunters believe that those who use the dark arts can be
revealed by immersion in a body of water. One theory is that water will
wash away their disguise and draw forth their true nature, another is that
a witch is such an abomination that pure water will reject the witch and
refuse to receive them. The witch hunter ties the suspect up and throws
them in a pond or river. If they surface, they are a witch, if they do not
they were clearly innocent.
Branding – It is said that no witch can stand the mark of Sigmar’s
hammer upon their flesh. Witch hunters sometimes brand people with
a hammer mark. If the hammer is clearly defined in the flesh then the
person is deemed not a witch. However, if its edges are distorted then the
person must be guilty, although different witch hunters might interpret
a brand mark in different ways. A person branded by a hammer mark
and pronounced innocent will wear the brand as a badge of pride, at
least until another witch hunter later reinterprets the scar. This has lead
some fearful peasant folk to brand themselves in an effort to prove their
innocence, before they are ever put to the question.
More information on witch hunters can be found in Realms of Sorcery.

Little Known Facts
Those that practice magic for any length of time find that it slowly but
surely begins to alter their perception of reality. It may start with simple
things, such as colours becoming more vivid or hearing whispered
voices on the wind, but over time it will lead to a fundamental change
in the magister’s mind.
By the time a wizard attains the rank of lord, he is irrevocably infused
with magic, the essence of it seeping into the very marrow of his bones
and trickling down into the darkest corners of his psyche. Such an
altered perception can result in unusual behaviour and, as all who deal
with such powerful wizards know, their mannerisms are more than mere
eccentricities. A wizard lord will often stare into the middle distance,
muttering under his breath or making strange hand gestures as if in
constant dialogue with an unseen force, a consequence of looking
constantly into the beyond.
Sometimes it is hard for a wizard lord to focus on the present, as his
mind wanders back and forth in time or is distracted by the colourful
flow of magic that caresses the object he should be concentrating on.
Of course, in moments of urgency, a wizard can shake off his reverie,
and the source of his distraction becomes the tool with which he forges
his great power.
The Call to War
When a wizard’s power reaches its peak and he attains the highest ranks
within the Colleges of Magic, he also takes on a sacred duty to use his
power to protect the Empire in times of strife. Members of the Colleges
of Magic understand that they were created and are allowed to prosper
in order to protect the Empire from those that would destroy it. So,
in times of war, the Emperor calls upon his most powerful wizards to
march to battle alongside his armies and use their gifts to strike down
his foes. It is a duty that wizard lords accept as part of the price of their
power and one that most perform willingly.
Of course, this duty to the Emperor can come in many forms, and
while the most common is service in times of war, it can sometimes
manifest in more subtle duties. Wizard lords not averse to open warfare
might be expected to pay a tithe of potions or magical artefacts to the
Emperor to aid his forces in battle, or might agree to raise some of their
apprentices as battle mages, wizards specifically trained to devastate the
Emperor’s enemies with destructive battlefield powers.

Gazing into the Void: It is said that those who gaze too long into
void will see the void looking back. The wizard lord Hadrak has been
different of late, his mind wanders and he spends hours talking to the
air in strange tongues. His peers and apprentices are worried that his
mind might be going, but perhaps something darker is afoot.
The Politics of Magic: Verthur Girtz has long aspired to become the
new head of the Amethyst Collage and has fought a war of both politics
and prestige to attain his goal. His fellow Amethyst wizards question
Girtz’ motives, but do not wish to raise any suspicions. Someone new,
someone not so deeply embedded in the College’s politics should
investigate to see if they can learn more about Girtz’s plans through his
colleagues and apprentices.

Little Known Facts
Woodsmen have skin like leather, from constant exposure to the
elements. When working in the heat of summer, some woodsmen are
known to coat themselves in tree sap to keep insects away, which gives
them a curious, woody smell.
Woodsmen know how to treat bark so it can be worked like thick
leather. Woodsmen often have bracers, greaves and shoe soles made
from bark, which is more durable than leather or cloth.
Woodsmen are careful to maintain their patch of forest, planting an
acorn where they fell an oak, nurturing saplings and clearing the forest
floor of undergrowth that might stunt the growth of new trees.
For several misguided reasons, woodsmen have traditionally been
considered mortal enemies of wood elves. In reality they share a
common interest in caring for the forest environment that sustains their
livelihoods, but they each approach it from a different tact.
Notable Figures
Thangir Hrolkson may be the closest a human has ever come to being
an honorary elf. Raised in a small farming community at the edge of
the Drakwald Forest, Thangir grew up loving his woodland home. A
secretive clan of elves lived deep among the trees, and young Thangir
managed to befriend their children, playing with them in the woods
whenever he could slip away from his family.
As he grew older, Thangir followed in his father’s footsteps as a
woodsman in the service of the local lord. At first his elven friends
accused Thangir of betraying their trust, but gradually they realised
that he was protecting them even as he served his lord, cutting only
those trees along the forest’s edge and stopping anyone from trespassing
into the domain of the elves. The elves regard Thangir as a sort of elfbrother,
and on occasion they gift him with the fruits of their woodland
realm, left at the door of his remote cottage.
Thangir’s human neighbours, however, regard him as a crazed outcast,
a dabbler with dangerous forest spirits, and steer well clear, a situation
which suits Thangir well.

Chanting in the Woods: A hunting party has vanished into the
woods. The only person who knows the forest well enough to lead a
search party is the local woodsmen, but when approached he proves
extremely reluctant to take on the job. Gossip in town paints the
woodsman as a recluse who occassionally wanders into town, spinning
tales of strange lights and chanting in the woods late at night – tales
quickly dismissed by the townsfolk.
A Gathering of Axes: A trader is selling a box carved from a strange
silvery wood, as tough as iron. He claims it has been carved from the
wood of rare trees found deep in the Loren Forest. Woodsmen gather
from all around to explore the secrets of the forest. Whoever discovers
the location of these mysterious trees will earn a fortune exporting the
lumber to Middenland’s markets, but risks earning the enmity of the
wood elves who seek to protect the forest from meddlesome humans.

Wrecker
Well, well, well... Would you look at what just washed up?
(WC) The long rivers of the Old World are dangerous places, made all the more so by
Wreckers. These river pirates seek to sink vessels and then raid the wrecks. Their techniques
for doing this vary, although most lure the unwary into rocky shallows to hole their
hulls. Although only interested in cargo, some Wreckers make a habit of killing, wary of
escapees that may inform Riverwardens of their identities or locations. In lean times, it is
not unknown for entire communities to turn to wrecking to feed their starving families.
Whilst most are of these are desperate and only “short-term” sorts, some Wrecker crews
are very experienced, targeting even well guarded traders. Such crews rarely stay in one
place for any length of time, for their activities soon draw attention from Riverwardens,
Bounty Hunters and local Militiamen.
Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Wrecker for
Smuggler with your GM’s approval.

A Day in the Life
Wreckers work hard for their money, just like most labourers and
businessmen. The only difference is that their business isn’t always
strictly legal – or completely ethical. It is work, though, and that
requires effort. The most important thing for a wrecker is keeping track
of any ships in his vicinity, and of any approaching vessels. Wreckers
have their territories, which they jealously guard, and they know every
rock and every current in their area. They also know exactly how long
a ship should take to get to any point within their territory, so once a
likely candidate is spotted they can plan accordingly.
Wreckers keep tabs on every ship in the area, but also on every guard
and lighthouse keeper and fisherman – they need know who might see
a ship, who might offer it aid, and who will look the other way when
there’s wrecking to be done. Wreckers also live by their equipment, so a
portion of each day is spent checking over their poles and belaying pins
and ropes, making sure everything is in perfect working order. Most
wreckers have small boats as well, so they can get to a sinking ship while
it’s still on the rocks, and those are also carefully maintained.
Wrecking is almost always done under cover of darkness, so during
the day a wrecker will check the territory for any ships, check in with
lookouts and allies, check his equipment, and then rest in case there’s
action that night. Of course some wreckers have more respectable jobs
during the day, so they have to balance working those jobs and being
rested enough to be effective at night.
Little Known Facts
In times of war, wreckers often become their area’s greatest defenders.
They’re already skilled at destroying approaching ships, so they can
easily keep single ships and even pairs or trios from reaching the shore
safely.
Some wreckers try to salvage not only a downed ship’s cargo but the
ship itself – they lure the ships ashore in spots where the ship will
ground out but not tear out its keel, and then capture or scare away the
crew and sail the ship to a safe harbour, where they keep it until they
can sell it to someone else.
Wreckers are masters at fighting on uneven surfaces and shifting terrain.
They are also experts at night-fighting and at battling during storms. As
a result, they are almost impossible to distract or confuse in conflict.
Most wreckers do not consider themselves bad men. They don’t hurt
sailors any more than necessary, and the goods they take do eventually
make their way to market, so in a sense the only people truly hurt by
wreckers are the merchants, who can afford the loss better than most.
Adventure Seeds
The Prize Awaits!: Word reaches the character that a heavily laden
merchant ship will be passing by soon. That’s a fat prize the wrecking
crew lucky enough to seize it – and the character plans for it to be him
and his men! There isn’t a moment to lose!
Rival Wreckers: A ship crashes along the shore, breaks apart, and
vanishes beneath the waves. Rumour has it the ship was picked clean
before it disappeared into the depths. But the character and his crew
didn’t do it! Which means, if the stories are true, there are other
wreckers working in their territory!

Yeoman
It’s bloody work, but it beats breakin’ yer back in the fields.
(KotG) Yeomen are the elite peasant warriors of Bretonnia. Many knights are dismissive of
their achievements, arguing that “elite peasant warrior” has a similar meaning to “large mouse.”
However, whilst it is true that the nobility are far better equipped, the Yeomen are as skilled as
most Knights of the Realm, and they take justified pride in their martial abilities.
Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Yeomen are dedicated professionals because it is their
dedication that has distinguished them from the mass of Men-at-Arms around them. Yeomen, in
return, receive mounts and are used for scouting missions that are unsuited to knights (too little glory,
too much risk). Eventually, some Yeomen grow tired of making things easy for “social superiors” and
strike out on their own.
Most lords allow their Yeomen to retire honourably after a few years of service or after a spectacular act
on the battlefield. Others, however, simply desert, usually whilst on a scouting mission so that their
lord assumes they were killed and doesn’t go after them.

Rumours Heard Around the Fire
Yeomen are often better disciplined than their newly knighted
counterparts, having at least seen a battle and whetted their weapons.
Some yeomen have taken up sword and shield and become knights
errant, using their skills to eventually earn knighthood and renown, so
long as they can keep their low birth a secret.
Yeomen and knights have a strange relationship. Yeomen are peasants,
of course, so they should defer to the knights, who are noble-born.
But both are warriors, and on the battlefield it is often the yeoman
who steps up and defeats a foe while the knight is hampered by codes
of conduct. As a result, most knights have a grudging respect for
yeomen, and allow them a level of familiarity otherwise unseen between
the classes. However, this does not extend beyond the battlefield—a
yeoman can shout at a knight and most knights will not take offense,
recognizing a warning or rebuke from a fellow combatant and putting
the comment to good use, whereas outside of battle, the same comment
may result in the yeoman’s death.
Yeomen take no vows and have no code of conduct, so they can do
whatever it takes to accomplish their tasks and come out alive. This also
means they can scavenge corpses, so yeomen often help themselves to
the weapons, armour, and money of fallen foes. They consider this their
due, since they are not paid much and often have only what equipment
they can buy or scrounge for themselves.
Because of their own low birth, yeomen understand other peasants far
better than knights do, and can use this to their advantage. A smart
yeoman makes friends with the soldiers and men-at-arms around him,
knowing these men will then help him if he needs aid.
Notable Figures
Geoffrey Whistler became a soldier because he was big and strong and
didn’t want to continue working the fields like the rest of his family.
He was never particularly violent but had no aversion to bloodshed
either, as long as it happened to someone else. His size and strength,
coupled some intelligence and a willingness to work hard, earned him
an appointment as a Man at Arms.
After distinguishing himself in a particularly bloody battle by crawling
across the field and bludgeoning the opposing commander to death,
Geoffrey was made a yeoman. He has remained one for several years
now, which is rare—most yeomen are dead after a year’s service in the
peasant infantry. He is well known for his fine armour (taken from that
same commander), his skill with the studded club he wields, and his
habit of whistling cheerfully as he cracks heads in battle.

Divided Loyalties: Lacking a better alternative, a yeoman is sent to
scout out a possible mercenary camp. He finds the camp easily enough,
but now has to decide—is he better off returning and reporting it, or
staying and joining them?
The Sole Survivor: A bloody encounter between a band of peasant
rabble and marauding goblins has left a single lone survivor, a
mysterious stranger caked in blood and gore. The local lord is willing to
grant him the title of yeoman and bequeath upon him a horse, however,
the survivor’s strange behaviour leads the noble to believe perhaps the
peasants did not die at the hands of the goblins, after all.

Zealot
O great and mighty Sigmar, why hast thou forsaken me? Show me the light that I might find repentance. Show me
the path that I may walk with you. Show me the truth so that I may dedicate myself to thee! My life for thee, O
Sigmar, my life for thee!
(Core) Zealots have lost it all. Maybe their families were murdered by Beastmen or their villages sacked by
Orcs. Or conniving Merchants destroyed their businesses or powerful Nobles carried off their daughters.
Whatever the case, nothing was left for these men and women but religion. They found solace in the
angry sermons of the warrior Priests of Sigmar or Ulric. Now they wander the Empire in tattered
clothes, looking to smite the minions of evil and Chaos. They want redemption through
blood – be it their own or that of their enemies. They may not have the training of Soldiers
but they do have the fire of faith and that is a strong weapon indeed.

The Brotherhood of Saint Soeren of the Sword
This dangerous band of zealots has been gathered together by one mad
visionary, Nikolaus Hoff. A former tradesman who lost everything
thanks to a risky shipping scheme, Nikolaus turned to criminal elements
for a loan to see his business through. When he could not pay them,
they set fire to his house.
His lovely wife and children were consumed by the flames and he was
terribly burned. But then, amidst the searing pain, he had a vision of
an angel with an outstretched sword. As he crawled amongst the rubble
of his home, he found the only object to survive the fire – a charred
wooden statue of Saint Soeren of the Sword, his family’s protector. He
mounted the statue on a crude sort of standard and went off to follow
where the sword led him.
Nikolaus Hoff has attracted a crowd of like-minded zealots with his
fiery rhetoric and mad visions. They follow him on his mad march.
They are headed somewhere – but where that is, none can say. However,
it is fair to assume that with a band of this many madmen, inflamed
with Nikolaus’s constant sermons about justice and divine retribution,
their destination and journey will likely not be peaceful.
Brother Christoph Koenig the Crusader
When one of the Old World’s most famous judicial champions quit
his post and joined the ranks of the zealots, many took notice. Brother
Christoph did not have everything taken from him, instead he gave
away his possessions. Why is still unknown. Some say he had a vision.
Some say he killed an innocent man. Others whisper of a confrontation
with a demon. Whatever the cause, he surrendered all he owned save his
morning star and a tattered robe and went to confront evil.
Since then, it is doubtful that any zealot has been more effective in
destroying the forces of Chaos secreted within the Empire. Brother
Christoph seems to have an almost preternatural nose for corruption.
A powerfully built man, his appearance now is extreme and terrifying.
He is completely shaven and covered in tattoos of scripture from holy
texts, all promising hell to the unbeliever. He is fanatically dedicated to
his crusade, forsaking any assistance and ignoring any hardship.
This does not mean the authorities are grateful. Instead, they see
Christoph as dangerous and unpredictable, and wait for him to make a
mistake so they can finally get rid of him. Christop knows this but does
not care. Sigmar’s work is too important to be hampered by mere fear.
Adventure Seeds
I Forsee... Catastrophe!: A zealot has an ominous vision, seeing
portents of doom in his dreams. As the characters enter the town wher
the zealot preaches his crazed rantings, he points to a member of the
party, declaring the person possessed by an ancient daemon – that
the person fulfills the visions and prophecies he has been tirelessly
preaching. Needless to say, this can be very dangerous, especially if the
local populace starts to take the zealot seriously. After all, better safe
than sorry, right?
Reinforcements?: A town is about to be attacked by an orc raiding
party. The town militia is in disarray. In their hour of need, a wandering
band of zealots appears almost as if sent by the gods. Now all the party
has to do is convince them that their mission is in accordance with
Sigmar’s will. That, and win the battle that follows.
